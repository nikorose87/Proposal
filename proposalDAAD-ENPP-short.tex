\begin{abstract}
Nowadays, Lower Limb Prosthesis (LLP) are changing at a very fast pace, due to technological developments implemented in such devices. In addition, users have new demands about their prosthesis and they require absolute comfort and good performance. Unfortunately, the demand of LLP has risen mostly in third world countries because of the increment of vascular diseases (e.g., Diabetes Mellitus). However, people do not have the enough funds to acquire advanced prosthesis that return the capabilities of walking or jogging in a proper way.

Despite the fact that active prosthesis help people to reduce metabolic cost, those are heavier and more expensive than\emph{ Energy Storage and Return}(ESR\nomenclature{ESR}{Energy Storage and Return prosthesis}) prosthesis devices, produce uncomfortable noises and require more maintenance than passive ones. Moreover, components of the bionic prosthesis (i.e., actuators, battery, gearbox, among others) make the system highly inefficient. As a consequence, a higher quantity of external energy is required to allow the user having enough autonomy for a daily use.

The current work is a Ph.D. thesis, which purpose is manufacturing a novel customizable configuration of transtibial prosthesis. This device will provide the positive work needed for an amputee at the final stance phase through a passive dynamic system, it will take advantage of cellular solids properties for recycling the energetic lost at the initial contact of the gait.

%If the new configuration is successful, the prosthesis will not require the use of an actuator, hence its price and maintenance could be slower than the actives ones and the prosthesis will provide the enough amount of energy for a transtibial amputee at the final stance phase.

\section{MOTIVATION}

The demand of Lower Limb Prosthesis (LLP) is higher every day around the world, due to the constant increment of the principal causes of amputations. According to Ziegler \emph{et al.} \cite{Ziegler-Graham2008}, in the United States of America, amputations in 2008 were caused by vascular diseases (including diabetes) with 53,95\%, followed by trauma (e.g. accidents, warfare, among others) with 44,90\%, and cancer with 1,15\%. They estimated that in 2050 the number of amputees will have risen to 3,6 million \cite{Ziegler-Graham2008}. 

In 2015, the \emph{International Diabetes Federation (IDF\nomenclature{IDF}{International Diabetes Federation})} published the IDF atlas, which announced that the number of people with diabetes is between 340-536 million \cite{IDF2015}. Moreover, they estimated that this sickness will have affected 642 million of people worldwide by 2050.
  
It is believed that diabetes affects mostly the lower limbs, producing potential risks of suffering peripheral arterial illness, diabetic foot and, as a result, an amputation. The possibility of suffering an amputation will depend on race, gender, and age of the population, being different in many countries. Below, Fig. \ref{fig:N=0000FAmero-de-amputaciones} shows the number of amputations per 100.000 habitants caused by diabetes.
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig:N=0000FAmero-de-amputaciones}Population affected per 100.000 inhabitants during a specific period of time in each country. Adapted from Kroger and Knut \cite{KrogerKnut2015}.}

\end{figure}


Despite the lack of statistics of amputations in all countries, diabetes is considered the main cause of amputation around the world.

Even though bionic prosthesis supply more amount of energy than \emph{ Energy Storage and Return}(ESR) at final stance phase, those are extremely expensive for developing countries. Thus, we have to take into account those communities with a limited economic capacity to get those devices. In consequence, third world countries sacrifice good Quality of Life (QoL\nomenclature{QoL}{Quality of Life}) with low technology prosthesis \cite{Lemoyne}.

To sum up, contributing to the development of prosthetic devices for lower limbs has great relevance for improving disorders in pathological gait and therefore obtain better QoL. The strategy to recover the absence of limbs work is recycling energy of Initial Contact (IC\nomenclature{IC}{Initial Contact}) and return it during final stance phase. It is thought that this strategy could be cheaper than prosthesis with active actuators inside. 




\section{\label{sub:Estado-del-conocimiento:}STATE OF THE ART}


\subsection{State of the Art about Ankle-Foot Prosthesis}

This motivation encourages research on devices that restore energy loss in gait as efficiently as possible. Moreover, replacing ankle joint is a complex task because it should be able to manage its stiffness regardless the terrain or the type of gait. Great technological advances in prosthesis have been made worldwide. There are clearly two kinds of strategies in foot prosthesis: ESR prosthesis, which state-of-the-art was described by Versluys \emph{et al.} \cite{Versluys2009}; and bionic prosthesis, described by Cherelle \emph{et al.} \cite{Cherelle2014a} on what is considered a bionic prosthesis and, consequently, their types. Fig. \ref{fig:Categorizaci=0000F3n-seg=0000FAn-Cherelle} depicts a generalized representation of foot prosthesis classes, where the most implemented foot prosthesis  is the SACH, despite not having returning energy benefits in gait.

From left to right: SACH foot, sagital degree of freedom foot, OSSUR$\circledR$ flex foot, Echelon foot$\circledR$, Proprio foot from OSSUR$\circledR$ and BiOM$\circledR$ from iWalk Inc.}
\end{figure}

Principal strengths and weaknesses in prosthesis to date have been found, both for ESR and bionic prosthesis, which are depicted in Tables \ref{tab:Fortalezas,-debilidades-ESR}, and \ref{tab:Fortalezas-de-las-activas} - \ref{tab:Debilidades-pr=0000F3tesis-activas}, respectively. 

Furthermore, weaknesses in prosthesis generate biomechanical disorders in gait, which are mentioned in Table \ref{tab:Alteraciones-biomec=0000E1nicas-ESR} for ESR and Table \ref{tab:Alteraciones-biomec=0000E1nicas-activas} for bionics.

In spite of the fact that bionic prosthesis provide more benefits than passive ones in terms of dynamic improvements in gait, nowadays those prosthesis present disadvantages and some dynamic disorders in gait (See Table \ref{tab:Alteraciones-biomec=0000E1nicas-activas}).

ESR prosthesis are not able to reestablish the dynamic walking nor the metabolic cost, due to the absence of the lower limb. On the other hand, powered prosthesis have restored the positive work needed to return the controlled energy and satisfy the quasi-stiffness slope \cite{hansen2014ankle, Eshraghi2013} of lost ankle. However, methods to reestablish the energy are highly inefficient \cite{Cherelle2014a}, making those devices more complex and expensive compared to ESR.  

Literature has reported a variety of actuators, which are divided in: stiff actuators and Compliance actuators. The pros and cons are described in \nameref{sec:Ap=0000E9ndice-B:}. According to Vanderborght \emph{et al.} \cite{Vanderborght2013}, those actuators will undergo continuous development aiming to achieve the best energetic efficiency, stability, autonomy and a regular walking.

Even though some actuators have not been made yet, because of the geometric constraints to implement those components, some others have been implemented in commercial prosthesis (e.g. Series Elastic Actuator). That kind of actuators have shown an improvement in walking. Nevertheless, high electric power is required by the actuator, thus autonomy \footnote{Autonomy is calculated by number of steps until the powered prosthesis discharges. Generally, It must satisfy between 3000 to 5000 steps per day\cite{Grabowski2013}.} is reduced.      

Two variables were taken into account by Grimmer \cite{Grimmer2012, Grimmer2014} and Eslamy\cite{Eslamy2013, Eslamy2014} to determine efficiency on actuators. Those are \emph{Peak Power (\nomenclature{PP}{Peak Power}PP)} and  \emph{Energetic Requirement} (\nomenclature{ER}{Energetic Requirement}ER). The more PP and ER per cycle in the motor, the more electric energy required. 

Some actuators mentioned in Appendix A were studied to verify the requirements of the motor, and identify the more efficient. Fig. \ref{fig:Variables-mec=0000E1nicas-actuadores} shows the results of the most popular actuators used in foot prosthesis for a subject of 75 kg of mass and cadence at 1 m/s.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{20160414035751}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\label{fig:Variables-mec=0000E1nicas-actuadores}Mechanical requirements of varied prosthetic actuators. Results were obtained by mathematical modeling of each one \cite{Cherelle2014a}. Nomenclature: PEA: Parallel Elastic Actuator, CPEA: Clutched PEA, SEA (Opt. ER): SEA actuator focused on optimizing ER,
SEA (Opt. PP): SEA actuator focused on optimizing PP, EEA: Explosive Elastic Actuator. }
\end{figure}

It must be taken into account that the power required for each actuator does not consider energy losses made by the system, which are around 50-60\%; Hence, 600W are needed to generate pure power of 287 W by the motor \cite{Cherelle2014a}.


Based on the foregoing, from the gait analysis, it has been found that energy dissipation occurs when the velocity vector of the COM is redirected at each step-to-step transition \cite{Donelan2002}. In other words, the stance leg in every gait cycle, acts similarly to an inverted pendulum, in order to support the body COM. Consequently, when transition is made - in double support phase - the COM velocity is redirected and energy is lost at collision of the heel with ground \cite{Collins2010}. A graphic explanation can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:(A)-Representaci=0000F3n-de}A.

Therefore, Collins and Kuo \cite{Collins2010} built a prosthetic foot which initially recycled the energy lost at initial contact of the gait through the implementation of a compression spring. This spring stores the energy until late stance phase of gait to finally release it, with the purpose of providing positive work to amputees. Nevertheless, neither shock absorption was reduced, nor the system provided all energy needed to restablish a regular gait.

(B) The rate of work performed on the center of mass by ideal pendulum-like legs vs. stride time. Work is theoretically minimized by pushing off impulsively (indicated by arrows) just before the opposite leg’s collision (step-to-step transition indicated by darkened intervals above time axis). (C) Conceptual plot of center of mass work rate for human-like legs vs. stride time. Imperfectly rigid legs will smooth out the impulses, but the collision (hatched area) is nevertheless a possible source of energy for recycling if it can be captured, stored, and later released for push-off." }Paragraph and figure taken from Collins and Kuo\cite{Collins2010}.}


\end{figure}

In general, powered prosthesis follow the next procedure: an ESR foot is used as base, later the actuator is implemented for push-off; Then, a control strategy is needed for its use and finally a battery is installed as source of power. Based on the previous technique for restoring limb loss, a question arised: what other strategy could be implemented in prosthesis so that, it obtains a better efficiency?.  

To sum up, pathologies caused by lower limb amputations befall in extra expenditure of energy (i.e. metabolic cost) for patients, due to the absence of \emph{triceps surae} group, which generates approximately 80\% of the work needed for push-off. In spite of the fact that ESR prosthesis provide positive work at final stance phase, to date those are not able to provide all the needed work. On the other hand, powered prosthesis are capable of supplying positive work needed by an amputee, but, that type of prosthesis has lower autonomy than ESR since the integrated actuator is inefficient. Hence, the necessity of the design of passive dynamic systems (concept defined by McGeer \cite{mcgeer1990passive}) for foot prosthesis emerged. 

\subsection{Additive Manufacturing on Prosthesis}

The evolution of technological development in medicine is growing faster nowadays, from manufacturing prototypes for academic purposes to cloning a cell, a tissue or an organ to implant \cite{Michalski2014}. All the above range of facilities are due to Additive Manufacturing \nomenclature{AM}{Additive Manufacturing} - well known as 3D printing -, which principle is based on making pieces layer by layer, on the basis of CAD\nomenclature{CAD}{Computer Aided Design} models. AM pros and cons in comparison to traditional manufacturing are well described by Weller \emph{et al.}\cite{Weller2015} and Diegel \emph{et al.} \cite{Diegel2014}.  

Those advantages suited the necessities of prosthesis makers, who demonstrated that mechanical properties of printable materials accomplish the task demanded by a foot prosthesis \cite{South2010, Yap2015}. It is believed that concepts of prosthesis with AM will adapt new shapes and could possibly change its mechanical properties  dynamically, due to the combination of self-assembly technique and 3D printing. Some experiments have been reported by Tibbits \emph{et al.}\cite{Tibbits2014,Raviv2014} and Yu \emph{et al.}\cite{Yu2015}.

Even though few foot prosthesis are made from AM, all of them have uniform mechanical properties all over its structure, This affects negatively the accomplishment of elastic properties needed for satisfying ankle quasi-stiffness on the prosthesis. In addition, given the ability to add material freely in AM without manufacturing penalties, the shape and geometry could be adapted easily in case of changes in the anthropomorphicity of users (i.e. pediatric users).

\subsection{Optimal Design}

The trend of engineers to build \emph{ Finite Element Models}(FEM\nomenclature{FEM}{Finite Element Models})--- to simulate how complex products will perform --- has increased. Moreover, this method allows the designer to modify some changes in order to get better results, encouraging the implementation of optimization techniques in the most critical obstacles over the design \cite{Forrester2008}. 

In the mechanical design, optimization techniques such as topology optimization \cite{Sigmund2001, Andreassen2011}, shape optimization \cite{Munk2015} and topometry optimization are being exponentially used along the last two decades.

Furthermore, meta-analysis algorithms such as \emph{Multi Disciplinary Optimization} (MDO\nomenclature{MDO}{Multi Disciplinary Optimization}), \emph{Multi Objective Optimization Algorithms} (MOOA\nomenclature{MOOA}{Multi Objective Optimization Algorithms}) and \emph{Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithms} \cite{Wnag2006} (MOEA\nomenclature{MOOA}{Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithms}) have helped to reach a faster answer in the search for the optimal point in the design \cite{Suresh2010, Huang2010}.

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}

\begin{itemize}
\item The recent passive prosthesis for transtibial amputees produce disorders in the dynamic parameters of the gait, owing to the absence of positive work of the limb loss. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Question}

Which passive ankle-foot prosthesis based on cellular solids configurations, will generate the positive work needed for push-off, taking advantage of the energy lost at initial contact of the gait?

\subsection{Hypothesis}

A passive dynamic system (compound of cellular solids) within a passive ankle-foot prosthesis, configured to store energy in a controlled manner at initial contact of the early stance phase, will enable to return the stored energy after dorsiflexion phase.



\subsection{General and Specific Objectives}

\subsubsection{General Objective} To suggest an ankle-foot prosthesis being able to generate - through a passive dynamic system - the positive work needed for push-off after dual-flexion phase, taking advantage of the energy lost at initial contact of the gait.

\subsubsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify biomechanical parameters and the work-loop slope of ESR prosthesis users and non-amputees aiming to obtain the ankle quasi-stiffness of both cases.

\item Obtain a preliminary model of the ankle-foot prosthesis capable of storing energy (during initial contact until late dual-flexion phase), and returning it at dorsi-flexion phase in a controlled manner through the passive dynamic system.

\item Determine detailed configurations of cellular solids that accomplish the requirements of the preliminary model.
\item Validate the dynamic model of the ankle-foot prosthesis in comparison to an ESR prosthesis. \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Methodology and Activities}

The methodological procedure will be carried out through the extraction of statistical data, in order to obtain the ankle quasi-stiffness slope of prosthesis users and non-amputees, so as to compare the energetic gap between those cases. On the other hand, an \emph{in-silico} process to design the prosthesis is needed to propose the concept and verify its functionality. This simulation process will be done with the tentative computational framework proposed in Figure \ref{Marco-computacional}.

\subsection{Implications and Expected Results}

The level of impact in this research consist in a new concept of transtibial prosthesis capable of storing energy in many instances of the gait to return it in a controlled manner at final stance phase without the need of external power sources, stepping up energetic contribution in comparison with an ESR prosthesis.

On the other hand, ankle quasi-stiffness depends directly on weight and step length, therefore a customized ankle-foot prosthesis is needed to solve metabolic cost problems in users. In addition, uniform mechanical properties of ESR prosthesis are not able to reproduce the ankle quasi-stiffness properly. The more deficient ankle quasi-stiffness, the more metabolic cost is demanded. In contrast, powered prosthesis generate the positive work needed for an amputee, but its efficiency is much lower than ESR and, as a result, autonomy is reduced. Despite the fact that its electronic components help to get the prosthesis controlled, it increases the cost and third-world countries, where the most amount of amputees live, are not able to acquire one of these.

Moreover, new manufacturing techniques are able to customize the prosthesis according to the anthropometry of users and their specific biomechanical disorders; Hence, we can reach specific elastic properties at different sub-domains through a cellular solid configuration, which have never been seen in any kind of prosthesis.
