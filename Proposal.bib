The structures geometry is observed in a banana peel that contains a specific graded structure in a confined space. The structure is responsible for protecting the internal soft core at low impact velocities. Deformation modes, plateau stress, stroke, cell shape and impact energy absorption capabilities are studied on different models and the theoretical expressions are presented to predict the behavior of the structure at low velocities. This structure proves its worthiness over a regular honeycomb structure over a higher range of impact velocity under the same space/stroke constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional prosthetic feet cannot adapt to specific conditions such as walking on stairs or ramps. Amputees are therefore forced to compensate their prosthetic deficits by modifying the kinematics and kinetics of their lower limbs. The Proprio-Foot??? (Ossur) intends to reduce these compensation mechanisms by automatically increasing dorsiflexion during stair ambulation thanks to an adaptive microprocessor-controlled ankle. The present investigation proposes to analyze the biomechanical effects of the dorsiflexion adaptation in transtibial (TT) amputees during stair ambulation. Sixteen TT amputees and sixteen healthy controls underwent conventional 3D gait analysis. Kinematics and kinetics of the lower limbs were compared during stair ascent and descent performed by patients with the prosthetic foot set to a neutral ankle angle and with an adapted dorsiflexion ankle angle of 4??. Norm distance as well as minimum and maximal values of sagittal kinematics and kinetics were calculated for comparisons between patients and control subjects. For both stair ascent and descent, an improvement of the knee kinematics and kinetics could particularly be noticed on the involved side with an increase of the knee flexion and an increase of the knee moment during stance. Therefore, despite its additional weight compared to a conventional prosthetic ankle, the Proprio-Foot??? should be beneficial to active TT amputees whose knee musculature strength does not constitute a handicap. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents an efficient 88 line MATLAB code for topology optimization. It has been developed using the 99 line code presented by Sigmund (Struct Multidisc Optim 21(2):120–127, 2001)asastart- ing point. The original code has been extended by a density filter, and a considerable improvement in efficiency has been achieved, mainly by preallocating arrays and vector- izing loops. A speed improvement with a factor of 100 is obtained for a benchmark example with 7,500 elements. Moreover, the length of the code has been reduced to a mere 88 lines. These improvements have been accomplished without sacrificing the readability of the code. The 88 line code can therefore be considered as a valuable successor to the 99 line code, providing a practical instrument that may help to ease the learning curve for those entering the field of topology optimization. The paper also discusses simple extensions of the basic code to include recent PDE-based and black-and-white projection filtering methods. The com- plete 88 line code is included as an appendix and can be downloaded from the web site www.topopt.dtu.dk},

  Abstract                 = {Patients with an above-the-knee amputation often experience poor socket fit, which may become more problematic with minor weight changes, sweating, and skin problems. In 1999, the first author began using a transcutaneous, press-fit distal femoral intramedullary device with the distal, external portion serving as a hard point for attachment of an above-the-knee prosthesis (Fig. 1). The implant is placed in a retrograde fashion as a first stage, and approximately six to eight weeks later this is followed by stomatization, in which the distal aspect of the implant is exposed and an extension is added for fixation of the above-the-knee prosthesis. Thirty-seven patients underwent the procedure between 1999 and December 2009. The indications for surgery were persistent difficulties with the socket of an above-the-knee prosthesis after an above-the-knee amputation; the amputations had typically followed trauma but in some cases were for surgical treatment of a malignant tumor. Fig. 1 The Endo-Exo-Femurprosthesis is a transcutaneous, press-fit distal femoral intramedullary device with the distal, external aspect serving as a hard point for attachment of an above-the-knee prosthesis. \#\#\# Source of Funding There was no external funding source for this investigation. Br\aa nemark in Sweden is credited with the idea of a percutaneous, osteointegrated prosthesis, which has been successful in dental implantation. In 1997, Br\aa nemark performed the first procedure with a transcutaneous femoral intramedullary prosthesis, which was a 12-cm screw-type device for a patient who had undergone an above-the-knee amputation1. In 1999, ESKA Implants (Lubeck, Germany) produced the Endo-Exo-Femurprosthesis, which was first implanted into the femoral canal of a young man who had lost a leg in a motorcycle accident. Since then, the device has undergone design improvements, and by late 2009 it had been implanted in thirty-seven patients in Lubeck, Germany. The device is a modular, noncemented device that fits within the medullary canal of the femur and \ldots},

  Abstract                 = {The human ankle varies impedance and delivers net positive work during the stance period of walking. In contrast, commercially available ankle-foot prostheses are passive during stance, causing many clinical problems for transtibial amputees, including non-symmetric gait patterns, higher gait metabolism, and poorer shock absorption. In this investigation, we develop and evaluate a myoelectric-driven, finite state controller for a powered ankle-foot prosthesis that modulates both impedance and power output during stance. The system employs both sensory inputs measured local to the external prosthesis, and myoelectric inputs measured from residual limb muscles. Using local prosthetic sensing, we first develop two finite state controllers to produce biomimetic movement patterns for level-ground and stair-descent gaits. We then employ myoelectric signals as control commands to manage the transition between these finite state controllers. To transition from level-ground to stairs, the amputee flexes the gastrocnemius muscle, triggering the prosthetic ankle to plantar flex at terminal swing, and initiating the stair-descent state machine algorithm. To transition back to level-ground walking, the amputee flexes the tibialis anterior muscle, triggering the ankle to remain dorsiflexed at terminal swing, and initiating the level-ground state machine algorithm. As a preliminary evaluation of clinical efficacy, we test the device on a transtibial amputee with both the proposed controller and a conventional passive-elastic control. We find that the amputee can robustly transition between the finite state controllers through direct muscle activation, allowing rapid transitioning from level-ground to stair walking patterns. Additionally, we find that the proposed finite state controllers result in a more biomimetic ankle response, producing net propulsive work during level-ground walking and greater shock absorption during stair descent. The results of this study highlight the potential of prosthetic leg controllers that exploit neural signals to trigger terrain-appropriate, local prosthetic leg behaviors. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Although many studies have been carried out on prosthetic gait, the main parameters of below-knee amputee (BKA) gait are still poorly understood. The majority of the gait studies of amputees have focused on the temporal and distance variables, whereas kinetics of the gait may reveal more important information. The purpose of this study was to assess the prosthetic gait of transtibial amputees and compare it with the findings of other studies on BKA and able-bodied persons. Five male unilateral traumatic BKA between the ages of 32 and 77 years were tested. Ground reaction force data were combined with simultaneously recorded and subsequently digitized video data of coordinate motion to calculate joint kinetics data. The following variables were compared within the group and with those of nonamputees: linear velocity, relative angles, net moment, power, and work at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. The results of this study indicated that BKA perform a higher than normal hip extension, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion of the unaffected side, whereas having more than normal hip and knee flexion during stance on the affected side. It was also shown that amputees tend to generate little power during push-off of the prosthetic side. Major findings of this study confirmed that BKA perform an asymmetrical gait that is different from those of normal population.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of modern prosthetics is to replicate the function of the replaced limb or organ in the most capable and discreet fashion possible. However, even the most advanced, commercial, transtibial prostheses available today only passively adjust the position of the ankle during the swing phase of gait and return a portion of the userpsilas own gravitational input. To greatly improve the quality of life of a transtibial amputee, new technologies and approaches must be used to create a cutting-edge robotic ankle prosthesis which can perform on par with, if not outperform, the equivalent able-bodied human ankle. Initial attempts by us and others have had great success in providing the natural gait power and motion through all ranges of walking speeds. A new design is presented which governs both the coronal and sagittal angles and moments of the ankle joint to potentially provide unprecedented levels of athleticism and agility among transtibial amputees.},

Some experts have also argued that 3-D printing will significantly reduce the advantages of producing small lot sizes in low-wage countries via reduced need for factory workers.},

  Abstract                 = {We review and re-examine the description and separation of the spin and orbital angular momenta (AM) of an electromagnetic field in free space. While the spin and orbital AM of light are not separately-meaningful physical quantities in orthodox quantum mechanics or classical field theory, these quantities are routinely measured and used for applications in optics. A meaningful quantum description of the spin and orbital AM of light was recently provided by several authors, which describes separately conserved and measurable integral values of these quantities. However, the electromagnetic field theory still lacks corresponding locally-conserved spin and orbital AM currents. In this paper, we construct these missing local spin and orbital AM densities and fluxes that satisfy the proper continuity equations. We show that these are physically measurable and conserved quantities. These are, however, not Lorentz-covariant, so only make sense in the single laboratory reference frame of the measurement probe. The fluxes we derive improve the canonical (non-conserved) spin and orbital AM fluxes, and include a `spin-orbit' term that describes the spin-orbit interaction effects observed in nonparaxial optical fields. We also consider both standard and dual-symmetric versions of the electromagnetic field theory. Applying the general theory to nonparaxial optical vortex beams validates our results and allows us to discriminate between earlier approaches to the problem. Our treatment yields the complete and consistent description of the spin and orbital AM of free Maxwell fields in both quantum-mechanical and field-theory approaches.},

One double transtibial amputee, using dedicated sprinting prostheses, and five able-bodied sprinters participated in the study. The athletes performed submaximal and maximal sprints (60 m) on an indoor track. All of the participants ran three times at each speed (maximal and submaximal). The athletes??? kinematics were recorded using the Vicon 624 system with 12 cameras operating at 250 Hz. Four Kistler force plates (1250 Hz) were used to record ground reaction forces (GRF). External joint moments, joint work, and joint power were calculated from the GRF and the kinematic data. The analysis of total body kinetics revealed lower mechanical work during the stance phase for the double transtibial amputee using Cheetah prostheses than for the able-bodied athletes running at the same speed. The joint kinetics showed lower external joint moments and joint power at the hip and the knee joints and higher values of joint power at the (prosthetic) ankle joint of the amputee than for the able-bodied athletes. The ratio of the mechanical work at the ankle joint in the negative and the positive phase during stance was 0.907 for the carbon keels of the prostheses and 0.401 for the healthy ankle joints of the controls. The mechanical work at the knee joints was 11 times higher in the negative phase and 8.1 times higher in the positive phase during stance in the ablebodied athletes than in the double transtibial amputee sprinter. It was assumed that due to reduced work at the joints of the lower limbs and less energy loss in the prosthetic leg, running with the dedicated prostheses allows for maximum sprinting at lower metabolic costs than in the healthy ankle joint complex.},

Design: Before-After trial: subjects fitted with IP walked on programmable treadmill at speeds: 6min slow, 6min fast, 8min while speed changed, between slow, normal, and fast, every minute, and 6min normal. Breath-by-breath analysis of subject's expired air determined average VO2 (L/min) within each period. Procedure repeated after 1-week interval using PSPC prosthesis. Testing sessions supervised by experienced prosthetist. Setting: Rehabilitation centre. Subjects: Volunteer sample. Three men, unilateral transfemoral traumatic amputee patients, ages 39 to 59 years. Normally used ischial containment socket, Blatchford Endolite Stabilised Stance Flex knee with PSPC and Multiflex foot and ankle. Interventions: Fitting, programming, and alignment of IP (own socket) by Bioengineering Unit's resident prosthetist. IP's microprocessor programmed to facilitate five walking speeds. Main Outcome Measure: Physiological energy cost (VO2), of using IP compared to using PSPC mechanism. Results: Two subjects displayed reduced VO2 of between 5.6\% and 9.0\% using IP compared to PSPC prosthesis at a pace either faster or slower than their normal pace. Third subject showed no significant change in oxygen consumption despite IP trait being heavier. All subjects displayed reduced VO2 (averaging 4.1\%) using IP for period of variable speed walking. Conclusions: Although differences were small, they tend to indicate that use of the heavier IP unit lowered the energy cost of walking at speeds other than the amputee's normal pace.},

However, too little or too much stiffness is believed to increase the risk of musculoskeletal injury. Purpose. To provide a current update of the lower extremity stiffness literature as it pertains to both performance and injury. Summary. It appears that increased stiffness is beneficial to performance. As well it appears that there may be an optimal amount of stiffness that allows for injury-free performance. There is some evidence that increased stiffness may be related to bony injuries and decreased stiffness may be associated with soft tissue injuries. Further investigations should evaluate the relationship between stiffness and injury prospectively. Initial reports suggest that stiffness can be modified in response to the external environment or verbal cues.Relevance. A greater understanding of the role of stiffness in both performance and injury will provide a stronger foundation for the development of optimal training intervention programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Robotic prostheses have the potential to significantly improve mobility for people with lower-limb amputation. Humans exhibit complex responses to mechanical interactions with these devices, however, and computational models are not yet able to predict such responses meaningfully. Experiments therefore play a critical role in development, but have been limited by the use of product-like prototypes, each requiring years of development and specialized for a narrow range of functions. Here we describe a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis system that enables rapid exploration of a wide range of dynamical behaviors in experiments with human subjects. This emulator comprises powerful off-board motor and control hardware, a flexible Bowden cable tether, and a lightweight instrumented prosthesis, resulting in a combination of low mass worn by the human (0.96 kg) and high mechatronic performance compared to prior platforms. Benchtop tests demonstrated closed-loop torque bandwidth of 17 Hz, peak torque of 175 Nm, and peak power of 1.0 kW. Tests with an anthropomorphic pendulum "leg" demonstrated low interference from the tether, less than 1 Nm about the hip. This combination of low worn mass, high bandwidth, high torque, and unrestricted movement makes the platform exceptionally versatile. To demonstrate suitability for human experiments, we performed preliminary tests in which a subject with unilateral transtibial amputation walked on a treadmill at 1.25 ms-1 while the prosthesis behaved in various ways. These tests revealed low torque tracking error (RMS error of 2.8 Nm) and the capacity to systematically vary work production or absorption across a broad range (from -5 to 21 J per step). These results support the use of robotic emulators during early stage assessment of proposed device functionalities and for scientific study of fundamental aspects of human-robot interaction. The design of simple, alternate end-effectors would enable studies at other joints or with additional degrees of freedom.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is aimed at developing a smart actuator for assistive knee braces to provide assistance to disabled or elderly people with mobility problems. A magnetorheological (MR) actuator is developed to be used in assistive knee braces to provide controllable torque. TheMR actuator can work as a brake or a clutch. When active torque is needed, the DC motor works and the MR actuator functions as a clutch to transfer the torque generated by the motor to the leg; when passive torque is desired, the DC motor is turned off and theMR actuator functions as a brake to provide controllable passive torque. The prototype of the developedMR actuator is fabricated and experiments are carried out to investigate the characteristics of theMR actuator. The results show that theMR actuator is able to provide sufficient torque needed for normal human activities. Adaptive control is proposed for controlling the MR actuator. Anti-windup strategy is used to achieve better control performance. Experiments on the MR actuator under control are also performed to study the torque tracking ability of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {Transtibial (TT) amputations, or below-knee amputations, are among the most frequently performed major limb removals. To replace the missing limb, numerous prosthetic devices were developed. A study of the state-of-the-art in TT prostheses shows that none of the commercially available devices are capable of mimicking an able-bodied ankle-foot complex. Still on a research level, some powered prosthetic devices have the potential to improve amputee walking experience, but still need heavy and bulky actuators to provide the necessary power of propulsion. With the AMP-Foot 2.0, the authors propose a new concept for an energy efficient, powered transtibial prosthesis. Its design enables the use of a low power actuator which stores energy in springs during the complete stance phase that can be released at pushoff. Thanks to this, the size and weight of the actuator can be decreased considerably while the ankle still provides the full power necessary for forward propulsion. A prototype of the AMP-Foot 2.0 has been built and experiments with a transfemural amputee were conducted. The captured data is presented and analyzed throughout this article.},

In the clinical routine, the gait analysis is the main element for iden- tifying pathological disorders, supporting the diagnosis and facilitating a proper follow up. Traditionally, this analysis aims to establish the set of patterns that describe the dynamics of the system. However, this analysis is insufficient for some movements, especially for early stages of almost every pathological movement. The development of normal and pathological models has allowed to demostrate objective differences for each of these situations. In this article we present a summary of the models that describe the dynamics of the normal and pathological human gait, inspired by the morpho-physiology of the locomotor system. Furthermore, we perform an analysis of the effectiveness of the proposed models in the literature. Key},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Humans normally dissipate significant energy during walking, largely at the transitions between steps. The ankle then acts to restore energy during push-off, which may be the reason that ankle impairment nearly always leads to poorer walking economy. The replacement of lost energy is necessary for steady gait, in which mechanical energy is constant on average, external dissipation is negligible, and no net work is performed over a stride. However, dissipation and replacement by muscles might not be necessary if energy were instead captured and reused by an assistive device. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a microprocessor-controlled artificial foot that captures some of the energy that is normally dissipated by the leg and "recycles" it as positive ankle work. In tests on subjects walking with an artificially-impaired ankle, a conventional prosthesis reduced ankle push-off work and increased net metabolic energy expenditure by 23\% compared to normal walking. Energy recycling restored ankle push-off to normal and reduced the net metabolic energy penalty to 14\%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that reduced ankle push-off contributes to the increased metabolic energy expenditure accompanying ankle impairments, and demonstrate that energy recycling can be used to reduce such cost.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim of this study was to provide a non-invasive assessment of the dynamic properties of the ankle joint during human locomotion, with specific focus on the effects of gender and age. Accordingly, flexion-extension angles and moments, obtained through gait analysis, were used to generate moment-angle loops at the ankle joint in 120 healthy subjects walking at a same normalized speed. Four reproducible types of loops were identified: Typical Loops, Narrow, Large and Yielding loops. No significant changes in the slopes of the main loop phases were observed as a function of gender and age, with the exception of a relative increase in the slope of the descending phase in elderly males compared to adult females. As for the ergometric parameters, the peak ankle moment, work produced and net work along the cycle were slightly, but significantly affected, with progressively decrease in the following order: Adult Males, Adult Females, Elderly Males and Elderly Females. The evidence that only few of the quantitative aspects of moment-angle loops were affected suggests that the control strategy which regulates the biomechanical properties of the ankle joint during walking is rather robust and qualitatively consistent across genders and age.},

We determined the roll-over characteristics of a broad range of prosthetic feet and examined the effect of a variety of shoes on these characteristics. The body weight of a person acting on a prosthetic foot during roll-over was emulated by means of an inverted pendulum-like apparatus. Parameters measured were the effective radius of curvature, the forward travel of the center of pressure, and the instantaneous radius of curvature of the prosthetic feet. Finally, we discuss how these parameters relate to amputee gait. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: If a prosthetic foot creates resistance to forwards shank rotation as it deforms during loading, it will exert a braking effect on centre of mass progression. The present study determines whether the centre of mass braking effect exerted by an amputee's habitual rigid 'ankle' foot was reduced when they switched to using an 'Echelon' hydraulic ankle-foot device. METHODS: Nineteen lower limb amputees (eight trans-femoral, eleven trans-tibial) walked overground using their habitual dynamic-response foot with rigid 'ankle' or 'Echelon' hydraulic ankle-foot device. Analysis determined changes in how the centre of mass was transferred onto and above the prosthetic-foot, freely chosen walking speed, and spatio-temporal parameters of gait. FINDINGS: When using the hydraulic device both groups had a smoother/more rapid progression of the centre of pressure beneath the prosthetic hindfoot (p 0.001), and a smaller reduction in centre of mass velocity during prosthetic-stance (p 0.001). As a result freely chosen walking speed was higher in both groups when using the device (p 0.005). In both groups stance and swing times and cadence were unaffected by foot condition whereas step length tended (p 0.07) to increase bilaterally when using the hydraulic device. Effect size differences between foot types were comparable across groups. INTERPRETATION: Use of a hydraulic ankle-foot device reduced the foot's braking effect for both amputee groups. Findings suggest that attenuation of the braking effect from the foot in early stance may be more important to prosthetic-foot function than its ability to return energy in late stance.},

Differences between conditions were detected with the general linear method (factorial model). Barefoot running is characterized by a significantly larger external loading rate than the shod condition. The flatter foot placement at touchdown is prepared in free flight, implying an actively induced adaptation strategy. In the barefoot condition, plantar pressure measurements reveal a flatter foot placement to correlate with lower peak heel pressures. Therefore, it is assumed that runners adopt this different touchdown geometry in barefoot running in an attempt to limit the local pressure underneath the heel. A significantly higher leg stiffness during the stance phase was found for the barefoot condition. The sagittal kinematic adaptations between conditions were found in the same way for all subjects and at the three running velocities. However, large individual variations were observed between the runners for the rearfoot kinematics. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Low back pain (LBP) is a major secondary disabling condition following lower limb amputation including persons with above-knee and below-knee amputation. Whilst the increasing prevalence of this musculoskeletal problem in people with lower limb amputation is well recognised, the mechanisms of LBP in this population have been poorly explored. Asymmetrical movements and loading patterns have been found in persons following lower limb amputation and linked to the high prevalence of LBP in this population. However, some argue that such asymmetries are part of the 'normal' adaptive process following lower limb amputation. We hypothesise that there is potential for some of the kinematic and kinetic adaptations in the lumbopelvic and trunk region to be 'mal-adaptive', potentially acting as a contributing factor for the onset or maintenance of LBP symptoms in this population. Evidence for movement and muscle asymmetries around the lumbopelvic and lower limb region provides some support for an association between LBP and movement asymmetry in the general population. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesise that movement asymmetries will demonstrate an association with LBP in lower limb amputee populations. Previous studies investigating movement and loading patterns within this population have focused mainly on gait analysis. Therefore, there is a need for further research to investigate the presence and potential association of asymmetrical movement patterns of the lumbopelvic region with LBP in a range of specific functional tasks. Results of such studies will identify the asymmetrical movement patterns and functional tasks associated with LBP in this population.

  Abstract                 = {In the late eighteenth century, the invention of the flying shuttle, the steam engine, and other machines that replaced manual labor produced almost unimaginable changes in society. They marked the start of the industrial revolution, which influenced almost every aspect of daily life in some way. As the revolution progressed, society changed in every way. For the following two centuries, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented growth. The world's average per capita income increased over tenfold, while the world's population grew by a factor of six. Never before had the world seen such unprecedented change. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {In human walking, the center of mass motion is similar to an inverted pendulum. Viewing double support as a transition from one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method). Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support periods. We expected to find that the traditional combined limbs method underestimates external mechanical work by a substantial amount. We used both methods to measure the external mechanical work performed by humans walking over a range of speeds. We found that during double support, the legs perform a substantial amount of positive and negative external work simultaneously. The combined limbs measures of positive and negative external work were approximately 33{\%} less than those calculated using the individual limbs method. At all speeds, the trailing leg performs greater than 97{\%} of the double support positive work while the leading leg performs greater than 94{\%} of the double support negative work.},

  Abstract                 = {In the single stance phase of walking, center of mass motion resembles that of an inverted pendulum. Theoretically, mechanical work is not necessary for producing the pendular motion, but work is needed to redirect the center of mass velocity from one pendular arc to the next during the transition between steps. A collision model predicts a rate of negative work proportional to the fourth power of step length. Positive work is required to restore the energy lost, potentially exacting a proportional metabolic cost. We tested these predictions with humans (N=9) walking over a range of step lengths (0.4-1.1 m) while keeping step frequency fixed at 1.8 Hz. We measured individual limb external mechanical work using force plates, and metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry. As predicted, average negative and positive external mechanical work rates increased with the fourth power of step length (from 1 W to 38 W; r2=0.96). Metabolic rate also increased with the fourth power of step length (from 7 W to 379 W; r2=0.95), and linearly with mechanical work rate. Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions, rather than pendular motion itself, appears to be a major determinant of the metabolic cost of walking.},

  Abstract                 = {Laser beam machining (LBM) is one of the most widely used thermal energy based non-contact type advance machining process which can be applied for almost whole range of materials. Laser beam is focussed for melting and vaporizing the unwanted material from the parent material. It is suitable for geometrically complex profile cutting and making miniature holes in sheetmetal. Among various type of lasers used for machining in industries, CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers are most established. In recent years, researchers have explored a number of ways to improve the LBM process performance by analysing the different factors that affect the quality characteristics. The experimental and theoretical studies show that process performance can be improved considerably by proper selection of laser parameters, material parameters and operating parameters. This paper reviews the research work carried out so far in the area of LBM of different materials and shapes. It reports about the experimental and theoretical studies of LBM to improve the process performance. Several modelling and optimization techniques for the determination of optimum laser beam cutting condition have been critically examined. The last part of this paper discusses the LBM developments and outlines the trend for future research. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here we present an adaptive muscle-reflex controller, based on simulation studies, that utilizes an ankle plantar flexor comprising a Hill-type muscle with a positive force feedback reflex. The model's parameters were fitted to match the human ankle's torque-angle profile as obtained from level-ground walking measurements of a weight and height-matched intact subject walking at 1 m/s. Using this single parameter set, clinical trials were conducted with a transtibial amputee walking on level ground, ramp ascent, and ramp descent conditions. During these trials, an adaptation of prosthetic ankle work was observed in response to ground slope variation, in a manner comparable to intact subjects, without the difficulties of explicit terrain sensing. Specifically, the energy provided by the prosthesis was directly correlated to the ground slope angle. This study highlights the importance of neuromuscular controllers for enhancing the adaptiveness of powered prosthetic devices across varied terrain surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we investigated on peak power (PP) and energy (ER) requirements for different active ankle actuation concepts that can have both elasticity and damping characteristics. A lower PP or ER requirement is an important issue because it will lead to a smaller motor or battery. In addition to spring, these actuation concepts are assumed to have (passive) damper in series (series elastic-damper actuator SEDA) or parallel (parallel elastic-damper actuator PEDA) to the motor. For SEA (series elastic actuator), SEDA and PEDA, we calculated the required minimum motor PP and ER in different human gaits: normal level walking, ascending and descending the stairs. We found that for level walking and ascending the stairs, the SEA concept, and for descending, the SEDA, were the favorable concepts to reduce required minimum PP and ER in comparison to a DD (direct drive) concept. In SEDA concept, the minimum PP could be reduced to half of what SEA would require. Nevertheless, it was found that spring was always required, however damper showed 'task specific' advantages. As a result, if a simple design perspective is in mind, from PP-ER viewpoint, SEA could be the best compromise to be used for different above-mentioned gaits. For SEDA or PEDA concepts, a controllable damper should be used. In addition, our results show that it is beneficial to select spring stiffness in SEA, based on level walking gait. The PP and ER requirements would increase very slightly for stairs ascending, and to some extent (10.5\%) for descending as a consequence of this selection. In contrast, stiffness selection based on stair ascending or descending, increases the PP requirements of level walking more noticeably (17-24\%).},

This paper is an attempt to begin exploring the trade-off between extrinsic and intrinsic control modalities. In this case, between electromyographic (extrinsic) and several internal sensors that can be used for intrinsic control. We propose a method that will identify the particular features, taken from two trans-femoral amputee and one trans-tibial amputee, during locomotion on varying terrain, that perfectly discriminate between locomotion modes. From this we are able to identify the source of the discriminability from a large-set of features that does not depend on the type of amputation. Also, we comment on the use of this algorithm in selecting the most discriminatory and least encumbering sensor/feature combination for transitions when the ground underneath the foot is unknown for trans-tibial amputees.},

Fragmentation and blast injuries account for 56\% of all injuries produced within the Iraqi and Afghan theaters where, as of July 2009, 723 combatants have sustained lower extremity limb loss. If limb salvage is not practical, or fails, then amputation should be considered. Amputation can be a reliable means toward pain relief and improvement of function. Optimizing functional outcome is paramount when deciding on definitive amputation level. Preservation of joint function improves limb biomechanics in many cases. Increased limb length also allows for the benefits associated with articular and distal limb proprioception. Amputees with improved lower extremity function also usually exhibit less energy consumption. Function and length are generally directly correlated, whereas energy consumption and length are inversely related. This article discusses the surgical principles of lower extremity amputation and postoperative management of amputees, and the various prosthetic options available.},

  Abstract                 = {Most prosthetic feet are designed to improve amputee gait by storing and releasing elastic energy during stance. However, how prosthetic foot stiffness influences muscle and foot function is unclear. Identifying these relationships would provide quantitative rationale for prosthetic foot prescription that may lead to improved amputee gait. The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of altered prosthetic foot stiffness on muscle and foot function using forward dynamics simulations of amputee walking. Three 2D muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations of unilateral below-knee amputee walking with a range of foot stiffness levels were generated, and muscle and prosthetic foot contributions to body support and propulsion and residual leg swing were quantified. As stiffness decreased, the prosthetic keel provided increased support and braking (negative propulsion) during the first half of stance while the heel contribution to support decreased. During the second half of stance, the keel provided decreased propulsion and increased support. In addition, the keel absorbed less power from the leg, contributing more to swing initiation. Thus, several muscle compensations were necessary. During the first half of stance, the residual leg hamstrings provided decreased support and increased propulsion. During the second half of stance, the intact leg vasti provided increased support and the residual leg rectus femoris transferred increased energy from the leg to the trunk for propulsion. These results highlight the influence prosthetic foot stiffness has on muscle and foot function throughout the gait cycle and may aid in prescribing feet of appropriate stiffness.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND Below-knee amputees commonly experience asymmetrical gait patterns and develop comorbidities in their intact and residual legs. Carbon fiber prosthetic feet have been developed to minimize these asymmetries by utilizing elastic energy storage and return to provide body support, forward propulsion and leg swing initiation. However, how prosthetic foot stiffness influences walking characteristics is not well-understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of foot stiffness on kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity, prosthetic energy storage and return, and mechanical efficiency during amputee walking. METHODS A comprehensive biomechanical analysis was performed on 12 unilateral below-knee amputees. Subjects walked overground at 1.2m/s with three prosthetic feet of varying keel and heel stiffness levels, which were created using additive manufacturing. FINDINGS As stiffness decreased, peak residual and intact leg ankle angles and residual leg knee flexion angle increased. The residual and intact leg braking ground reaction forces and knee extensor moments, residual leg vastus and gluteus medius activity, and intact leg vastus and rectus femoris activity also increased. The second vertical ground reaction force peak and hamstring activity in the residual leg and first vertical ground reaction force peak in the intact leg decreased. In addition, prosthetic energy storage and return increased and mechanical efficiency decreased as stiffness decreased. INTERPRETATION Decreasing foot stiffness can increase prosthesis range of motion, mid-stance energy storage and late-stance energy return, but the net contributions to forward propulsion and swing initiation may be limited as additional muscle activity to provide body support becomes necessary.},

  Abstract                 = {The fixed neutral position of conventional prosthetic feet causes difficulties for transtibial amputees (TTAs) when walking on ramps. New microprocessor-controlled prosthetic ankles such as the Proprio-Foot (Ossur) aim to reduce these difficulties by modifying the prosthetic ankle angle according to the gait condition. The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the biomechanical effects of adaptation of the prosthetic ankle on ramp ambulation in TTAs. Sixteen TTAs and 16 controls underwent a conventional 3D gait analysis while walking up and down a ramp. TTAs walked with the prosthetic foot set to a neutral mode angle and set to the adapted mode. Norm distance, sagittal kinematics and kinetics were calculated for comparisons between TTAs and controls. During ramp ascent, the dorsiflexion brought about by the adapted prosthetic ankle reduced the increased knee extension noted on the TTAs' involved side and the increased plantarflexion on their sound side. During ramp descent, the plantarflexion of the adapted mode increased the adaptation mechanisms observed in TTAs. These findings suggest that the adapted mode leads to more physiologic kinematics and kinetics in the lower limbs in TTAs during ramp ascent but not during ramp descent. However, in the adapted mode, patients reported feeling safer during ramp descent, thus indicating that there might be other safety related measures such as toe-clearance or coefficient of friction influencing this perception.},

  Abstract                 = {Background The increased injury risk in older runners has been associated with alterations in muscle strength, flexibility, and gait biomechanics. This study investigated whether older runners exhibit changes in muscle strength, flexibility and running biomechanics compared to younger runners, and possible relationships between these changes. Methods Thirty-five young (20-36 yrs) and 35 older (55-71 yrs) recreational runners participated in the study. Measures of three-dimensional biomechanical data during treadmill running at 2.7 m/s and measures of muscle strength and flexibility were compared between groups. A correlation analysis between biomechanical and clinical variables was also performed. Findings Older runners demonstrated an overall reduction in muscle strength and flexibility, and altered running patterns compared to young runners but correlations between clinical and biomechanical variables were scarce. Reduced hip, ankle and trunk excursions along with reduced knee and ankle positive work were found in older runners. Older runners also exhibited increased knee abduction impulse, ankle abduction impulse and vertical loading rates. In contrast, older runners did not present a distal-to-proximal lower extremity joint moment redistribution. Interpretation We observed age-related reduced strength and flexibility concomitant with alterations in running biomechanics, but a lack of correlation between these variables. This finding hampers the use of single, or even a subset of characteristics to better understand age-related changes in runners. The observed changes are complex and multivariate in nature. Clinicians will most likely have to monitor both clinical and biomechanical characteristics to optimize care. However, future studies need to prospectively address what are biomechanical age-related risk factors in runners. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize and compare dynamic joint stiffness (DJS) of the ankle in the sagittal plane during natural cadence walking in both genders. DESIGN: Observation, cross-sectional and matched pairs. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one males (mean age=27+/-4.2 years) and 18 females (mean age=22.9+/-4.1 years). SETTING: Laboratory at the University de Tr\'{a}s-os-Montes and Alto Douro. The DJS of the ankle was assessed while participants performed barefoot walking at a natural cadence, was measured using a force platform (1000 Hz), and synchronized with a high-speed camera (200 Hz). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DJS of the ankle in males and females was calculated in two sub-phases (the second and the fourth sub-phases) of the stance phase. The Wilcoxon non-parametric matched-pairs test and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test were used to analyse difference of DJS of the ankle within and between the groups with p0.05 regarded as significant. RESULTS: Male and female participants demonstrated significantly (p<0.005) less DJS during the second sub-phase. DJS was not significantly (p>0.063) different between females (0.0511 N m/kg/ degrees ) and males (0.0596 N m/kg/ degrees ) during the second sub-phase. DJS was significantly (p<0.001) higher in males (0.0844 N m/kg/ degrees ) than females (0.0691 N m/kg/ degrees ) during the fourth sub-phase. CONCLUSIONS: Gender-specific DJS characteristics demonstrated by females in this study may be used in preventative training programs designed to promote a greater ability to use contractile components to produce mechanical energy through the ankle.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Recent research has focused on the design of intelligent prosthetic ankle devices with the goal of adapting behavior of the device to accommodate all walking surfaces that an individual encounters in daily life. To date, no studies have looked at how such devices perform on uneven terrain. METHODS: 11 young adults with unilateral transtibial amputation participated in two data collection sessions spaced approximately 3 weeks apart. In each session they walked across a loose rock surface at three controlled speeds. In the first session, they wore a passive, energy storage and return prosthesis and in the second, they wore a powered prosthesis (BiOM, iWalk, Bedford, MA, USA). FINDINGS: Subjects had a 10\% faster self-selected walking speed when wearing the powered (1.16 m/s) compared to unpowered prosthesis (1.05 m/s; p=0.031). They walked with increased ankle plantarflexion on their prosthetic limb throughout the gait cycle when wearing the powered compared to unpowered prosthesis. This was especially evident in the increased plantarflexion during push-off (p<0.001). There was a small (<3??), but statistically significant decrease in knee flexion during early stance when wearing the powered device (p=0.045). Otherwise, the kinematics of the knee and hip were nearly identical when wearing the different devices. Subjects had decreased medial-lateral motion of their center of mass when wearing the powered prosthesis (p=0.020), but there were no differences in medial-lateral margins of stability between the devices (p=0.662). INTERPRETATION: Subjects did not significantly alter their proximal joint kinematics on this irregular surface as a result of the addition of power.},

Ten healthy subjects were asked to walk (1) across a level walkway, (2) up, and (3) down an instrumented stairway. Sagittal plane kinematic and kinetic data were analyzed to obtain ankle biomechanics during the stance phase of each task. Each stance phase was broken down into sub-phases based on the power trajectory. The ideal model was taken to be the simplest combination of mechanical elements (springs, dampers, and torque actuators) that could reproduce the patterns observed in ankle biomechanics. Besides, we studied the transitions from level walking to stair ascent and from stair descent to level walking and showed that mechanical elements can be used to model these transitions as well. These results are promising to the design of next generation ankle orthotic and prosthetic systems because they show that relatively simple mechanical elements can be utilized to mimic ankle biomechanics.},

  Abstract                 = {Workers exposed to knee straining postures, such as kneeling and squatting, may present modifications in knee gait kinematics that can make them vulnerable to osteoarthritis. In this study, knee kinematics of workers exposed to occupational knee straining postures (KS workers) were compared to those of non-knee straining (non-KS) workers. Eighteen KS workers and 20 non-KS workers participated in the study. Three-dimensional gait kinematic data were recorded at the knee using an electromagnetic motion tracking system. The following parameters were extracted from flexion/extension, adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation angle data and used for group comparisons: knee angle at initial foot contact, peak angles, minimal angles and angle range during the entire gait cycle. Group comparisons were performed with Student t-tests. In the sagittal plane, KS workers had a greater knee flexion angle at initial foot contact, a lower peak knee flexion angle during the swing phase and a lower angle range than non-KS workers (p < 0.05). In the frontal plane, all parameters indicated that KS workers had their knees more adducted than non-KS workers. External/internal rotation range was greater for KS workers. This study provides new knowledge on work related to KS postures and knee kinematics. The results support the concept that KS workers might exhibit knee kinematics that are different from those of non-KS workers. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Background People with a lower-extremity amputation that use conventional passive-elastic ankle-foot prostheses encounter a series of stress-related challenges during walking such as greater forces on their unaffected leg, and may thus be predisposed to secondary musculoskeletal injuries such as chronic joint disorders. Specifically, people with a unilateral transtibial amputation have an increased susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis, especially in their unaffected leg. Previous studies have hypothesized that the development of this disorder is linked to the abnormally high peak knee external adduction moments encountered during walking. An ankle-foot prosthesis that supplies biomimetic power could potentially mitigate the forces and knee adduction moments applied to the unaffected leg of a person with a transtibial amputation, which could, in turn, reduce the risk of knee osteoarthritis. We hypothesized that compared to using a passive-elastic prosthesis, people with a transtibial amputation using a powered ankle-foot prosthesis would have lower peak resultant ground reaction forces, peak external knee adduction moments, and corresponding loading rates applied to their unaffected leg during walking over a wide range of speeds. Methods We analyzed ground reaction forces and knee joint kinetics of the unaffected leg of seven participants with a unilateral transtibial amputation and seven age-, height- and weight-matched non-amputees during level-ground walking at 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, and 1.75 m/s. Subjects with an amputation walked while using their own passive-elastic prosthesis and a powered ankle-foot prosthesis capable of providing net positive mechanical work and powered ankle plantar flexion during late stance. Results Use of the powered prosthesis significantly decreased unaffected leg peak resultant forces by 2-11% at 0.75-1.50 m/s, and first peak knee external adduction moments by 21 and 12% at 1.50 and 1.75 m/s, respectively. Loading rates were not significantly different between prosthetic feet. Conclusions Use of a biomimetic powered ankle-foot prosthesis decreased peak resultant force at slow and moderate speeds and knee external adduction moment at moderate and fast speeds on the unaffected leg of people with a transtibial amputation during level-ground walking. Thus, use of an ankle-foot prosthesis that provides net positive mechanical work could reduce the risk of comorbidities such as knee osteoarthritis.},

  Abstract                 = {Elastic elements in prosthetic devices can help to reduce peak power (PP) and energy requirements (ER) for the actuators. Calculations showed that it is impossible with current commercial motor technology to mimic human ankle behavior in detail for higher walking and running speeds with single motor solutions using a Serial Elastic Actuator (SEA). Concerning this result we checked the requirements of a parallel elastic actuator (PEA) and a combination of serial and parallel (SE+PEA) springs. We found that a PEA can reduce PP additionally in comparison to the SEA by pre-loading the spring in the ???ight phase. This reduces also peak torque. But this loading needs additional energy so that the ER increase in comparison to the SEA. The SE+PEA concept can further decrease PP. With that, the ER are less than the PEA but higher than for the SEA. The results show less benefit for the PEA and the SE+PEA when a constant stiffness and a fixed parallel spring slack length is used for both gaits and all speeds. All concepts show that mimicking human ankle joint behavior in running and walking at higher speeds is still challenging for single motor devices.},

Simulation studies have shown that similar advantages are possible for the knee joint. The aims of this paper were to investigate the advantages of a monoarticular SEA-driven hip joint and to quantify the energetic benefit of an SEA-driven leg (with monoarticular hip, knee and ankle SEAs), assuming that damping (negative power) is passively achieved. The hip SEA provided minor energetic advantages in walking (up to 29\%) compared to the knee and the ankle SEA. Reductions in required peak power were observed only for speeds close to preferred walking speed (18\% to 27\%). No energetic advantages were found in running, where a DD achieved the best performance when optimizing for energy. Using an SEA at each leg joint in the sagittal plane reduced the positive work by 14\% to 39\% for walking and by 37\% to 75\% for running. When using an SEA instead of a DD, the contribution of the three leg joints to doing positive work changed: the knee contributed less and the hip more positive work. For monoarticular SEAs, the ankle joint motor did most of the positive work.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method for providing volitional control of a powered knee prosthesis during nonweight-bearing activity such as sitting. The method utilizes an impedance framework, such that the joint can be programmed with a given stiffness and damping that reflects the nominal impedance properties of an intact joint. Volitional movement of the knee joint is commanded via the stiffness set-point angle of the joint impedance, which is commanded by the user as a function of the measured surface electromyogram (EMG) from the hamstring and quadriceps muscles of the residual limb. Rather than using the respective EMG measurements from these muscles to directly command the flexion or extension set point of the knee, the presented approach utilizes a combination of quadratic discriminant analysis and principal component analysis to align the user's intent to flex or extend the knee joint with the pattern of measured EMG. The approach was implemented on three transfemoral amputees, and their ability to control knee movement was characterized by a set of knee joint trajectory tracking tasks. Each amputee subject also performed the same set of trajectory tracking tasks with his sound side (intact) knee joint. The average root mean square trajectory tracking errors of the prosthetic knee employing the EMG-based volitional control and the intact knee of the three subjects were 6.2?? and 5.2??, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this study was to understand the macroscopic mechanical structure and function of biological muscle with respect to its dynamic role in the contraction. A recently published muscle model, deriving the hyperbolic force-velocity relation from first-order mechanical principles, predicts different force-velocity operating points for different load situations. With a new approach, this model could be simplified and thus, transferred into a numerical simulation and a hardware experiment. Two types of quick release experiments were performed in simulation and with the hardware setup, which represent two extreme cases of the contraction dynamics: against a constant force (isotonic) and against an inertial mass. Both experiments revealed hyperbolic or hyperbolic-like force-velocity relations. Interestingly, the analytical model not only predicts these extreme cases, but also additionally all contraction states in between. It was possible to validate these predictions with the numerical model and the hardware experiment. These results prove that the origin of the hyperbolic force-velocity relation can be mechanically explained on a macroscopic level by the dynamical interaction of three mechanical elements. The implications for the interpretation of biological muscle experiments and the realization of muscle-like bionic actuators are discussed. ?? 2012 Jilin University.},

  Abstract                 = {In the growing fields of wearable robotics, rehabilitation robotics, prosthetics, and walking k robots, variable stiffness actuators (VSAs) or adjustable compliant actuators are being designed and implemented because of their ability to minimize large forces due to shocks, to safely interact with the user, and their ability to store and release energy in passive elastic elements. This review article describes the state of the art in the design of actuators with adaptable passive compliance. This new type of actuator is not preferred for classical position-controlled applications such as pick and place operations but is preferred in novel robots where safe human- robot interaction is required or in applications where energy efficiency must be increased by adapting the actuator's resonance frequency. The working principles of the different existing designs are explained and compared. The designs are divided into four groups: equilibrium-controlled stiffness, antagonistic-controlled stiffness, structure-controlled stiffness (SCS), and mechanically controlled stiffness.},

  Abstract                 = {The non-disabled human ankle joint was examined during walking in an attempt to determine overall system characteristics for use in the design of ankle prostheses. The hypothesis of the study was that the quasi-stiffness of the ankle changes when walking at different walking speeds. The hypothesis was examined using sagittal plane ankle moment versus ankle angle curves from 24 able-bodied subjects walking over a range of speeds. The slopes of the moment versus ankle angle curves (quasi-stiffness) during loading appeared to change as speed was increased and the relationship between the moment and angle during loading became increasingly non-linear. The loading and unloading portions of the moment versus angle curves showed clockwise loops (hysteresis) at self-selected slow speeds that reduced essentially to zero as the speed increased to self-selected normal speeds. Above self-selected normal speeds, the loops started to traverse a counter-clockwise path that increased in area as the speed was increased. These characteristics imply that the human ankle joint could be effectively replaced with a rotational spring and damper for slow to normal walking speeds. However, to mimic the characteristics of the human ankle during walking at fast speeds, an augmented system would be necessary. This notion is supported by the sign of the ankle power at the time of opposite heel contact, which was negative for slow speeds, was near zero at normal speeds, and was positive for fast walking speeds. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The EFLR multiplied by 100 provides the percentage of a foot that is effectively used during a walking step and may have clinical implications for step length and limb loading on the contralateral side. Prosthetic feet were manually rolled over a force platform while maintaining a constant level of force representative of a user's weight. Effective foot lengths were measured by finding the distance from the heel of each prosthetic foot to the center of pressure in foot-based coordinates at a loading angle that represented the approximate shank angle at opposite heel contact during walking. The effective foot lengths were then normalized by overall foot length to determine the EFLR. EFLRs from 15 prosthetic feet used clinically during the 1990s are presented along with an estimate of the EFLR of the physiologic ankle-foot system. All prosthetic feet had EFLRs lower than the corresponding physiologic system, although some had ratios close to the physiologic system. The EFLRs for the prosthetic feet were between 0.63 and 0.81, whereas the EFLR estimated for the physiologic system was 0.83.},

  Abstract                 = {Virtual testing using dynamic finite element simulations is an efficient way to investigate the mechanical behaviour of small- and large-scale structures reducing time- and cost-expensive prototype tests. Furthermore, numerical models allow for efficient parameter studies or optimisations. One example, which is the focus of this paper, is the configurational design of cellular sandwich core structures. From classical honeycomb cores to innovative folded core structures, a relatively large design space is provided allowing for tailoring of the cellular core geometry with respect to the desired properties. The method of determining the effective mechanical properties of such cellular sandwich core structures of different geometries using dynamic compression, tensile and shear test simulations is discussed covering a number of important modelling aspects: the cell wall material modelling, the influence of mesh size and number of unit cells, the inclusion of imperfections, etc. A comparison of numerical and experimental results is given for Nomex{\textregistered} honeycomb cores and Kevlar{\textregistered} or carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) foldcore structures. A good correlation with respect to cell wall deformation mechanisms and stressâ€“strain data was obtained. Therefore, these models not only allow for a complete mechanical characterisation of cellular core structures but also for a detailed investigation of cell wall deformation patterns and failure modes to get a better understanding of the structural behaviour, which can be difficult using solely experimental observations. To show that this efficient virtual testing method is suitable for the development of cellular core geometries for specific requirements, an optimisation study of a CFRP foldcore geometry with respect to its compressive behaviour was performed.},

  Abstract                 = {Several studies have used variability of continuous relative phase (CRP) to investigate overuse injuries, since low variability is thought to be related to running injuries. This study investigates whether the analysis of CRP variability leads to additional information about possible differences or similarities between healthy and injured runners. Further, a decision about future applications of CRP variability should be based on the ability to implement and interpret data. 18 healthy female runners (CO) and 18 female runners who suffered from iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) were evaluated by calculating CRP variability for 4 coupling pairs. Besides analyzing continuous variability of CRP, we also averaged it for the whole stance phase and for four predefined stance phase intervals. Confidence intervals were displayed and independent t-tests for comparing the two groups were conducted. During initial and terminal stance phase as well as after heel-off an increase in CRP variability was detected for both groups of runners. In contrast, the foot flat period was characterized by stable joint coordination and a decrease in variability. This paper presents possible interpretations of CRP variability but no statistically significant differences in CRP variability were found between the two groups of runners. Despite the missing statistical significance, a relationship between high CRP variability and injury seems to be conceivable, since the injured runners demonstrated an increased variability for all couplings in the first half of the stance phase. Further application of CRP variability in biomechanical research is essential to determine whether a relationship exists between injury and coordination variability. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Direct skeletal attachments for transfemoral amputees have been the subject of clinical trials since the early nineties. This method of attachment allows the amputee an unrestricted range of motion around the hip joint, better sitting comfort, improved sensory feedback through osseoperception, improved limb control and reduced soft tissue problems. However, the length of the rehabilitation period is perceived as a shortcoming by the amputees and the clinicians. The aim of the present study is to estimate the risk of failure during gait, for a patient with direct skeletal attachment of a femoral prosthesis, using finite element analysis (FEA). Material properties and loads were derived from subject-specific data and implant stability assumed secured by bone ingrowth into a porous implant surface. A simplified FEA was used to optimize the implant geometry with respect to load bearing capacity. The resulting geometry was then implemented in a subject-specific FE study. The results indicate that the risk of failure for the implant system is approximately three times greater than what can be expected for an intact femur. The main conclusion, based on the risk of failure factors calculated, is that it is likely that a porous-coated implant could be beneficial for osseointegrated fixation. It is also suggested that the proposed methodology can be used in future studies exploring the mechanical stability of osseointegrated fixation in the view of improving direct skeletal attachments for lower limb amputees.},

A bionic prosthesis has been developed that emulates the function of a biological ankle during level-ground walking, specifically providing the net positive work required for a range of walking velocities. We compared metabolic energy costs, preferred velocities and biomechanical patterns of seven people with a unilateral transtibial amputation using the bionic prosthesis and using their own passive-elastic prosthesis to those of seven non-amputees during level-ground walking. Compared with using a passive-elastic prosthesis, using the bionic prosthesis decreased metabolic cost by 8 per cent, increased trailing prosthetic leg mechanical work by 57 per cent and decreased the leading biological leg mechanical work by 10 per cent, on average, across walking velocities of 0.75???1.75 m s???1 and increased preferred walking velocity by 23 per cent.

The goal of this paper is to establish practical guidelines for verification and validation of NMS models and simulations that researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and others can adopt to evaluate the accuracy and credibility of modeling studies. In particular, we review a general process for verification and validation applied to NMS models and simulations, including careful formulation of a research question and methods, traditional verification and validation steps, and documentation and sharing of results for use and testing by other researchers. Modeling the NMS system and simulating its motion involves methods to represent neural control, musculoskeletal geometry, muscle-tendon dynamics, contact forces, and multibody dynamics. For each of these components, we review modeling choices and software verification guidelines; discuss variability, errors, uncertainty, and sensitivity relationships; and provide recommendations for verification and validation by comparing to experimental data and testing robustness. We present a series of case studies to illustrate key principles. In closing, we discuss the challenges for the community to ensure the continued successful translation of modeling and simulation to analyze and solve the broad spectrum of problems necessary to improve human mobility.},

For unilateral, transtibial amputees, we hypothesize that increasing the power output of the trailing, ankle-foot prosthesis during powered plantar flexion could mitigate kinetic loading applied to the leading, contralateral leg during walking. Here, we present a case series that analyzes kinetic factors of unilateral, transtibial amputee gait and forms a comparison between two types of ankle prostheses with varying power outputs. The factors examined here are impact resultant force, peak foot pressure at heel-strike, step-to-step transition work, and knee external adduction moment. The two prostheses are the amputee participant's daily-use passive ankle-foot prosthesis and the BiOM powered ankle-foot prosthesis capable of biologically accurate powered plantar flexion during late stance. In a preliminary study on two transtibial amputees walking over level terrain at a controlled speed (1.25 m/s), we observed average reductions of 8\% in peak impact resultant force, 18\% in impact resultant force loading rate, 8\% in peak heel-strike foot pressure, and 15\% in the 1(st) peak knee external adduction moment when the powered ankle-foot prosthesis was compared to the conventional passive prosthesis. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that more biomimetic prosthetic ankle-foot push-off during late stance may limit leading-leg musculoskeletal stress in walking.},

  Abstract                 = {In walking the human body is never in balance. Most of the time the trunk is supported by one leg and the centre of mass (CoM) 'falls' to the contralateral side. In dynamical situations the velocity of the CoM should be acknowledged as well in the 'extrapolated centre of mass' (XcoM). Centre of pressure (CoP) position was recorded by a treadmill with built-in force transducers. Lateral CoM and XcoM position were computed by filtering the CoP data. Subjects were six above-knee amputees and six matched healthy controls. They walked at approximately 0.75, 1, and 1.25 m/s for 2 min. Amputees showed asymmetric gait with shorter stance (60\%) at the prosthetic side versus 68\% at the non-prosthetic side and a wider stride (13 ?? 4 cm, mean ?? S.D.) compared to controls (9 ?? 3 cm). At foot placement CoP was just lateral to the XcoM. The margin between average CoP and XcoM at foot contact was only 1.6 ?? 0.7 cm in controls, 2.7 ?? 0.5 cm in amputees at the prosthetic side and 1.9 ?? 0.6 cm at the non-prosthetic side. Next to this 'stepping strategy', CoP position was corrected after initial contact by modulating the lateral foot roll-off ('lateral ankle strategy') in non-prosthetic legs up to about 2 cm. A simple mechanical model, the inverted pendulum model, can explain that: (1) a less precise foot placement (greater CoP-XcoM margin) results in a wider stride, (2) this effect can be reduced by walking with a higher cadence, and (3) a greater margin at one side, as with a leg prosthesis, should be compensated by a shorter stance duration at the same side to achieve a straight path. This suggests that not in all cases symmetric gait should be an aim of rehabilitation. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To be practically implemented, such a mechanism must not only run on batteries, but sustain a long running time between recharging. Using springs to passively and actively store and supply energy to the robotic ankle, small DC motors can be optimized to perform high peak power tasks without sacrificing efficiency and net energy usage. Additional techniques are explored with the potential of substantially reducing the energy requirements as well as the size and weight of the prosthesis. The benefits of adding a unidirectional parallel spring with a Robotic Tendon are weighed and the possibility of actively varying the lever arm at which the spring force is applied is analyzed. The different actuation methods are compared to determine which methods work best in different gait regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {During level-ground walking, mechanical work from each leg is required to redirect and accelerate the center of mass. Previous studies show a linear correlation between net metabolic power and the rate of step-to-step transition work during level-ground walking with changing step lengths. However, correlations between metabolic power and individual leg power during step-to-step transitions while walking on uphill/downhill slopes and at different velocities are not known. This basic understanding of these relationships between metabolic demands and biomechanical tasks can provide important information for design and control of biomimetic assistive devices such as leg prostheses and orthoses. Thus, we compared changes in metabolic power and mechanical power during step-to-step transitions while nineteen subjects walked at seven slopes (0??, +/???3??, +/???6o, \& +/???9??) and three velocities (1.00, 1.25, \& 1.50m/s). A quadratic model explained more of the variance (R2 = 0.58-0.61) than a linear model (R2 = 0.37???0.52) between metabolic power and individual leg mechanical power during step-to-step transitions across all velocities. A quadratic model explained more of the variance (R2 = 0.57???0.76) than a linear model (R2 = 0.52???0.59) between metabolic power and individual leg mechanical power during step-to-step transitions at each velocity for all slopes, and explained more of the variance (R2 = 0.12???0.54) than a linear model (R2 = 0.07???0.49) at each slope for all velocities. Our results suggest it is important to consider the mechanical function of each leg in the design of biomimetic assistive devices aimed at reducing metabolic costs when walking at different slopes and velocities.},

For each preparation power output was maximal at a particular frequency, although the peaks were rather broad.

Then, finite element stress analyses are carried out to obtain effective mechanical properties such as compressive Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. It is shown that finite element results are in close agreement with the results in literature.},

  Abstract                 = {The availability of human walking gait data collected from the wearable acceleration sensors for trajectory control of an active artificial ankle joint in the unilateral trans-tibial prosthesis was investigated in this study. It is observed that the collected acceleration data can be used in the rulebased control of the prosthetic leg. A portable microprocessor-based data acquisition system, and data transfer module were designed for capturing the acceleration signals during walking. Flexionextension angle pattern of ankle joint was determined from acceleration signals of two tri-axial wearable accelerometers placed on the shank and foot segments. This pattern was utilized for control of the active artificial ankle joint in the trans-tibial prosthesis. This approach may have the potential of contributing the development of better prostheses.},

DESIGN: Repeated-measures design to evaluate comparative functional outcomes. SETTING: Exercise physiology laboratory and community free-living environment. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=15; 12 men, 3 women; age, 42+/-9 y; range, 26-57 y) with transfemoral amputation. INTERVENTION: Research participants were long-term users of a mechanical prosthesis (20+/-10 y as an amputee; range, 3-36 y). They were fitted with a microprocessor-controlled knee prosthesis and allowed to acclimate (mean time, 18+/-8 wk) before being retested. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Objective measurements of energy efficiency and total daily energy expenditure were obtained. The Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire was used to gather subjective feedback from the participants. RESULTS: Subjects demonstrated significantly increased physical activity-related energy expenditure levels in the participant's free-living environment (P=.04) after wearing the microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee joint. There was no significant difference in the energy efficiency of walking (P=.34). When using the microprocessor-controlled knee, the subjects expressed increased satisfaction in their daily lives (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: People ambulating with a microprocessor-controlled knee significantly increased their physical activity during daily life, outside the laboratory setting, and expressed an increased quality of life.},

Similar to laser and inkjet printers, 3-D (three-dimensional) printers produce pieces by depositing, or adding, layers of material???plastic, polymer filaments, metals, and even foodstuffs???until the desired product is realized. This means that the creation and production of ???one-offs??? is not only easy, it is also economically viable. 3-D printers are becoming ever more affordable, and it is not hard to envision them being as common in most homes in the near future as their two-dimensional counterparts are today. This article presents a 3-D printing primer for non-technical managers. It then considers the profound impact that 3-D printing will have on firms of all kinds as well as on individual consumers. In addition, it raises the substantial questions that 3-D printing will pose to policy makers from both intellectual property and ethical standpoints.},

  Abstract                 = {Millivolt level signals generated in residual muscles can be used to control sophisticated upper limb prosthetics. The low level voltages known as surface-electromyogram (sEMG) signals have seldom been applied in lower limbs due to moisture, large pressure, and shear forces which induced anomalies, and in particular triboelectric interference. An electronic module, known as a multi-sensor unit or MSU incorporates a multiplicity of sensors which promises to overcome the problems with sEMG in lower limbs. By incorporating a multiplicity of signals from what is physically happening in terms of pressure, temperature, and surface shear, it is anticipated that the sEMG signals can be corrected. Testing of the MSU with able bodied personnel and amputees is currently under way at Clarkson University. The MSU, which is totally potted is soft silicone rubber, measures sEMG, pressure, axial and tangential shear, and temperature. The 35 \#x00D7;65 \#x00D7;6.5mm electronic module is thin enough to be comfortably inserted between the liner of the prosthetic and the residual lower limb. As part of the program, a unique MEMS shear sensor, capable of being totally encased in silicone rubber, was developed. The temperature and pressure sensor are based on commercial off-the-shelf sensors. The design of the shear sensors is based on bonding a glass ball to a commercial off-the-shelf pressure sensor, thus avoiding the costly development of a custom shear sensor. The final MSU is both waterproof and rugged. Preliminary test results are briefly presented.},

MR fluid changes its rheology depending on the intension of an applied magnetic field. The brake using MR fluid (we call it MR brake) has a simple structure and can control its braking force with a low voltage. Prosthesis users often tumble because they don't have dorsiflexor, so that we propose putting MR brake taking the place of dorsiflexion. We hope that prosthesis users can walk more naturally and smoothly by use of developed intelligent prosthetic ankle joint with MR brake. We developed a prototype of it and evaluated it with walking experiments before. But there were some problems with the prototype in terms of hardware and experimental environments. Therefore we have developed a 2nd prototype of the intelligent prosthetic ankle joint with the MR brake, which was improved considering previous problems, and then we have carried out the walking experimental evaluation of it},

  Abstract                 = {Recreational running has many proven benefits which include increased cardiovascular, physical and mental health. It is no surprise that Running USA reported over 10 million individuals completed running road races in 2009 not to mention recreational joggers who do not wish to compete in organized events. Unfortunately there are numerous risks associated with running, the most common being musculoskeletal injuries attributed to incorrect shoe choice, training errors and excessive shoe wear or other biomechanical factors associated with ground reaction forces. Approximately 65\% of chronic injuries in distance runners are related to routine high mileage, rapid increases in mileage, increased intensity, hills or irregular surface running, and surface firmness. Humans have been running barefooted or wearing minimally supportive footwear such as moccasins or sandals since the beginning of time while modernized running shoes were not invented until the 1970s. However, the current trend is that many runners are moving back to barefoot running or running in "minimal" shoes. The goal of this masterclass article is to examine the similarities and differences between shod and unshod (barefoot or minimally supportive running shoes) runners by examining spatiotemporal parameters, energetics, and biomechanics. These running parameters will be compared and contrasted with walking. The most obvious difference between the walking and running gait cycle is the elimination of the double limb support phase of walking gait in exchange for a float (no limb support) phase. The biggest difference between barefoot and shod runners is at the initial contact phase of gait where the barefoot and minimally supported runner initiates contact with their forefoot or midfoot instead of the rearfoot. As movement science experts, physical therapists are often called upon to assess the gait of a running athlete, their choice of footwear, and training regime. With a clearer understanding of running and its complexities, the physical therapist will be able to better identify faults and create informed treatment plans while rehabilitating patients who are experiencing musculoskeletal injuries due to running. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Control schemes for powered ankle-foot prostheses would benefit greatly from a means to make them inherently adaptive to different walking speeds. Towards this goal, one may attempt to emulate the intact human ankle, as it is capable of seamless adaptation. Human locomotion is governed by the interplay among legged dynamics, morphology and neural control including spinal reflexes. It has been suggested that reflexes contribute to the changes in ankle joint dynamics that correspond to walking at different speeds. Here, we use a data-driven muscle-tendon model that produces estimates of the activation, force, length and velocity of the major muscles spanning the ankle to derive local feedback loops that may be critical in the control of those muscles during walking. This purely reflexive approach ignores sources of non-reflexive neural drive and does not necessarily reflect the biological control scheme, yet can still closely reproduce the muscle dynamics estimated from biological data. The resulting neuromuscular model was applied to control a powered ankle-foot prosthesis and tested by an amputee walking at three speeds. The controller produced speed-adaptive behaviour; net ankle work increased with walking speed, highlighting the benefits of applying neuromuscular principles in the control of adaptive prosthetic limbs.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a powered knee prosthesis with two series-elastic actuators positioned in parallel in an agonist-antagonist arrangement. To motivate the knee's design, we developed a prosthetic knee model that comprises a variable damper and two series-elastic clutch units that span the knee joint. Using human gait data to constrain the model's joint to move biologically, we varied model parameters using an optimization scheme that minimized the sum over time of the squared difference between the model's joint torque and biological knee values. We then used these optimized values to specify the mechanical and control design of the prosthesis for level-ground walking. We hypothesized that a variable-impedance control design could produce humanlike knee mechanics during steady-state level-ground walking. As a preliminary evaluation of this hypothesis, we compared the prosthetic knee mechanics of an amputee walking at a self-selected gait speed with those of a weight- and height-matched nonamputee. We found qualitative agreement between prosthetic and human knee mechanics. Because the knee's motors never perform positive work on the knee joint throughout the level-ground gait cycle, the knee's electrical power requirement is modest in walking (8 W), decreasing the size of the onboard battery required to power the prosthesis.},

Objectives: To investigate the hypothesis that increasing the mass and moment of inertia of the prosthetic limb of people with unilateral, transtibial amputations to match the mass and moment of inertia of the intact limb improves walking symmetry without increasing energy cost. Design: Gait symmetry and metabolic energy cost of walking for six subjects with unilateral, transtibial amputations were evaluated under three prosthesis loading conditions. Setting: University research laboratory. Subjects: Six ambulatory individuals with unilateral, transtibial amputations. Interventions: Subjects walked at 1.34m/sec under three prosthetic limb loading conditions: (1) no added load; (2) loading that produced a match of prosthetic shank and foot mass and moment of inertia with those of the intact limb (100\% load); and (3) a load that was half that of the 100\% condition (50\% load). Main Outcome Measures: Step length, swing time, stance time, and metabolic energy expenditure. Results: As mass and moment of inertia of the prosthetic limb became more closely matched to the intact limb, step length, swing time, and stance time became less symmetrical. Energy cost for the 100\% load condition was significantly greater (6\% to 7\%) than the baseline and 50\% conditions. Conclusions: The loading configuration required to produce a match in the moments of inertia of the prosthetic and intact lower legs resulted in greater gait asymmetry and higher energy cost. ? 2000 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation},

Experi ments with a test machine verify that the passive walking effect can be readily exploited in practice. The dynamics are most clearly demonstrated by a machine powered only by gravity, but they can be combined easily with active energy input to produce efficient and dextrous walking over a broad range of terrain.},

METHODS: Metabolic, mechanical and electromyographic measurements were made as healthy young (YOU; n = 12, age = 27 +/- 3 years) and older (OLD; n = 20, age = 74 +/- 3 years) men of equivalent body mass and leg length walked on a treadmill at four speeds (ranging from 0.83 to 1.67 m s(-1)). RESULTS: Net (above resting) C(W), determined by indirect calorimetry was 31{\%} higher (average across speeds) in OLD (P {\textless} 0.05). The integrity of the passive pendulum like interchange of mechanical energies of the centre of mass (COM(B)), an energy-saving mechanism, was maintained in OLD. Furthermore, total mechanical work, determined from fluctuations in mechanical energy of COM(B) and of body segments relative to COM(B), was not significantly elevated in OLD. This resulted in a lower efficiency in OLD (-17{\%}, P {\textless} 0.05). Co-activation, temporally quantified from electromyography recordings, was 31{\%} higher in OLD for antagonist muscles of the thigh (P {\textless} 0.05). Thigh co-activation was moderately correlated with C(W) at three speeds (r = 0.38-0.52, P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Healthy septuagenarians with no gait impairment have an elevated C(W) which is not explained by an elevation in whole body mechanical work. Increased antagonist muscle co-activation (possibly an adaptation to ensure adequate joint stability) may offer partial explanation of the elevated C(W).},

  Abstract                 = {Actuator efficiency is an important factor in the design of powered leg prostheses, orthoses, exoskeletons, and legged robots. A continuously-variable series-elastic actuator (CV-SEA) is presented as an efficient actuator for legged locomotion. The CV-SEA implements a continuously-variable transmission (CVT) between a motor and series elastic element. The CVT reduces the torque seen at the motor and allows the motor to operate in speed regimes of higher efficiency, while the series-elastic element efficiently stores and releases mechanical energy, reducing motor work requirements for actuator applications where an elastic response is sought. An energy efficient control strategy for the CV-SEA was developed using a Monte-Carlo minimization method that randomly generates transmission profiles and converges on those that minimize the electrical energy consumption of the motor. The CV-SEA is compared to a standard SEA and an infinitely variable series elastic actuator (IV-SEA). Simulations suggest that a CV-SEA will require less energy that an SEA or IV-SEA when used in a knee prosthesis during level-ground walking.},

  Abstract                 = {Lower extremity amputation not only limits mobility, but also increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis of the intact limb. Dynamic walking models of non-amputees suggest that pushing-off from the trailing limb can reduce collision forces on the leading limb. These collision forces may determine the peak knee external adduction moment (EAM), which has been linked to the development of knee OA in the general population. We therefore hypothesized that greater prosthetic push-off would lead to reduced loading and knee EAM of the intact limb in unilateral transtibial amputees. Seven unilateral transtibial amputees were studied during gait under three prosthetic foot conditions that were intended to vary push-off. Prosthetic foot-ankle push-off work, intact limb knee EAM and ground reaction impulses for both limbs during step-to-step transition were measured},

  Abstract                 = {Topology optimization has evolved rapidly since the late 1980s. The optimization of the geometry and topol-ogy of structures has a great impact on its performance, and the last two decades have seen an exponential increase in publications on structural optimization. This has mainly been due to the success of material distribution methods, originating in 1988, for generating optimal topologies of structural elements. Previous methods suffered from math-ematical complexity and a limited scope for applicability, however with the advent of increased computational power and new techniques topology optimization has grown into a design tool used by industry. There are two main fields in structural topology optimization, gradient based, where mathematical models are derived to calculate the sensitivi-ties of the design variables, and non gradient based, where material is removed or included using a sensitivity function. Both fields have been researched in great detail over the last two decades, to the point where structural topology opti-mization has been applied to real world structures. It is the objective of this review paper to present an overview of the developments in non gradient based structural topol-ogy and shape optimization, with a focus on evolutionary algorithms, which began as a non gradient method, but have developed to incorporate gradient based techniques. Starting with the early work and development of the popular algorithms and focusing on the various applications. The sensitivity functions for various optimization tasks are pre- sented and real world applications are analyzed. The article concludes with new applications of topology optimization and applications in various engineering fields.},

  Abstract                 = {Inverted pendulum models of walking predict that little muscle work is required for the exchange of body potential and kinetic energy in single-limb support. External power during walking (product of the measured ground reaction force and body center-of-mass (COM) velocity) is often analyzed to deduce net work output or mechanical energetic cost by muscles. Based on external power analyses and inverted pendulum theory, it has been suggested that a primary mechanical energetic cost may be associated with the mechanical work required to redirect the COM motion at the step-to-step transition. However, these models do not capture the multi-muscle, multi-segmental properties of walking, co-excitation of muscles to coordinate segmental energetic flow, and simultaneous production of positive and negative muscle work. In this study, a muscle-actuated forward dynamic simulation of walking was used to assess whether: (1). potential and kinetic energy of the body are exchanged with little muscle work; (2). external mechanical power can estimate the mechanical energetic cost for muscles; and (3.) the net work output and the mechanical energetic cost for muscles occurs mostly in double support. We found that the net work output by muscles cannot be estimated from external power and was the highest when the COM moved upward in early single-limb support even though kinetic and potential energy were exchanged, and muscle mechanical (and most likely metabolic) energetic cost is dominated not only by the need to redirect the COM in double support but also by the need to raise the COM in single support.},

However, claims have been made recently that not only have the functional disadvantages been redressed, but today's sprint prostheses may provide a mechanical advantage over the human limb.

A detailed study is presented, of the philosophy underpinning virtual testing schemes: highlighting the structure, challenges and opportunities posed by a virtual testing strategy compared with traditional laboratory experiments. The virtual testing process has been discussed from atomistic to macrostructural length scales of analyses. Several implementations of virtual testing frameworks for diverse categories of materials are also presented, with particular emphasis on composites, cellular materials and biomaterials (collectively described as heterogeneous systems, in this context). The robustness of virtual frameworks for prediction of the constitutive behaviour of these materials is discussed. The paper also considers the current thinking on developing virtual laboratories in relation to availability of computational resources as well as the development of multi-scale material model algorithms. In conclusion, the paper highlights the challenges facing developments of future virtual testing frameworks.

Furthermore, stabilization techniques such as the streamline upwind Petrov???Galerkin (SUPG) and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) are reviewed. The performance of the numerical schemes for both smooth and non-smooth benchmark problems is discussed.

  Abstract                 = {Evidence from biomechanics research suggests that tendon series elasticity allows muscle to act in an optimal range of its force-length and force-velocity curves to achieve work and power amplification. In this investigation we put forth a simple model to quantify the capacity of series elasticity to increase work and power output from an actuator. We show that an appropriate spring constant increases the energy that an actuator can deliver to a mass by a factor of 4. The series elasticity changes the actuator operating point along its force-velocity curve and therefore affects the actuator work output over a fixed stroke length. In addition, the model predicts that a series spring can store energy and deliver peak powers greater than the power limit of the source by a factor of 1.4. Preliminary experiments are performed to test model predictions. We find qualitative agreement between the model and experimental data, highlighting the importance of series elasticity for actuator work and power amplification across a fixed stroke length. We present several non-dimensional relations that can aid designers in the fabrication of robotic and prosthetic limbs optimized for work and power delivery. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {This book presents an introduction to viscoelasticity; in particular, to the theories of dilute polymer solutions and dilute suspensions of rigid particles in viscous and incompressible fluids. These theories are important, not just because they apply to practical problems of industrial interest, but because they form a solid theoretical base upon which mathematical techniques can be built, from which more complex theories can be constructed, to better mimic material behaviour. The emphasis is not on the voluminous current topical research, but on the necessary tools to understand viscoelasticity at a first year graduate level. The main aim is to provide a still compact book, sufficient at the level of first year graduate course for those who wish to understand viscoelasticity and to embark in modeling of viscoelastic multiphase fluids. To this end, a new chapter on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) was introduced which is relevant to model complex-structured fluids. All the basic ideas in DPD are reviewed, with some sample problems to illustrate the methodology.},

In accordance with the study protocol, a new version of the pylon (SBIP-3) was implanted into the hind leg residuum of three rabbits. The SBIP-3 has side fins that are designed to improve the bond between the bone and pylon. The fins are positioned inside two slots precut in the bone walls; their length can be adjusted to match the thickness of the bone walls. After 13 (animal 1) or 26 (animals 2 and 3) wk, the animals were sacrificed and samples collected for histopathological analysis. The space between the fins and the bone into which they were fit was filled with fibrovascular tissue and woven bone. No substantial inflammation was found.

In our previous studies of the porous SBIP-1 and SBIP-2 prototypes, the bond site between the porous pylons and residuum bone and skin did not show the inflammation characteristically observed when solid pylons are used. At the same time, porosity diminished the strength of the pylon. To find a reasonable balance between the biological conductivity and the strength of the porous pylon, we developed a mathematical model of the composite permeable structure. A novel manufacturing process was implemented, and the new SBIP-3 prototype was tested mechanically. The minimal strength requirements established earlier for the SBIP were exceeded threefold. The first histopathological analysis of skin, bone, and the implanted SBIP-2 pylons was conducted on two rats and one cat. The histopathological analysis provided new evidence of inflammation-free, deep ingrowth of skin and bone cells throughout the SBIP structure.},

  Abstract                 = {El presente informe describe un estudio de factibilidad t\'{e}cnica y comercial del proyecto Pr\'{o}tesis de pie y Rodilla, el cual comienza con un breve antecedente de c\'{o}mo inici\'{o} el proyecto en el GSED y como se fue desarrollando desde su creaci\'{o}n en el a\~{n}o 2009. Este proyecto involucr\'{o} a la Universidad Militar como ente ejecutor, al Hospital Militar como asesor t\'{e}cnico y a la Industria Militar como productor del prototipo y gestor del proyecto, cuyos resultados fueron el desarrollo de una rodilla hidr\'{a}ulica polic\'{e}ntrica y un pie de alta respuesta din\'{a}mica. Todo se debe al an\'{a}lisis realizado por la Subgerencia T\'{e}cnica y Comercial, el cu\'{a}l inicia describiendo un panorama nacional de 8.572 v\'{\i}ctimas (entre civiles y militares) heridas en Colombia por las MAP, y que de acuerdo a las estad\'{\i}sticas realizadas, el 90\% de esas v\'{\i}ctimas son amputadas de sus miembros inferiores. La DGSM, el HOMIC, DISAN-EJC y la DISAN PONAL muy amablemente suministraron a INDUMIL las estad\'{\i}sticas sobre los dispositivos prot\'{e}sicos implantados a los usuarios de las FF. MM. Para el caso de HOMIC se obtuvieron registros desde 2009 hasta marzo de 2014, encontrando que de los amputados de miembro inferior en el Hospital, el 77\% es amputado transtibial (por debajo de rodilla), el 21\% es amputado transfemoral (por encima de rodilla) y el 2\% tiene alg\'{u}n otro tipo de amputaci\'{o}n. De los datos anteriores se puede decir que el 21\% de los amputados del HOMIC requiere rodilla, teniendo un promedio de consumo de 82 pr\'{o}tesis anuales; en cambio, el pie pasa a tener una cobertura del 98\% de los amputados, con un promedio anual de 296 pr\'{o}tesis de pie. Para el caso de la DISAN-EJC s\'{o}lo se obtuvieron datos estad\'{\i}sticos desde 2011 a 2013, describiendo un consumo anual en promedio de 398 para el caso del pie y de 106 para el caso de la rodilla. Como valor agregado se conoci\'{o} que el mayor consumo de pr\'{o}tesis en usuarios de las FF.MM se da por el recambio de sus pr\'{o}tesis antiguas, que duran alrededor de 3 a\~{n}os de vida \'{u}til en promedio. Los usuarios nuevos demandan el 20\% del consumo total en Ej\'{e}rcito Nacional. Por \'{u}ltimo, de DISAN-PONAL se obtuvo que la demanda de miembros superiores es mayor en un 19\% en comparaci\'{o}n con el Ej\'{e}rcito Nacional y que sus principales causas no se dan por las Minas Anti-persona, se dan por enfermedades generales y accidentes de tr\'{a}nsito. La demanda de pr\'{o}tesis no supera las 30 anuales. Ahora bien, recopilando toda la necesidad del cl\'{u}ster del GSED se determin\'{o} que la demanda para los dos productos es ligeramente creciente al largo plazo (10 a\~{n}os), teniendo una necesidad anual de 194 pr\'{o}tesis de rodilla y de 724 pr\'{o}tesis de pie para 2015. Para el 2018 se prev\'{e} un consumo de 198 rodillas y 743 pies.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer simulations are playing an increasingly important role in solving complex engineering problems, and have the potential to revolutionize experimentally-based medical decision making and treatment design. Experiments alone provide important but limited understanding of movement dynamics. Although we can measure some quantities, such as muscle activities and ground reaction forces, responsible for a movement, simulations complement these measurements with estimates of other important variables, such as muscle and joint forces. Simulations also allow us to establish cause-and-effect relationships giving insights into muscle function. Perhaps the most exciting feature of simulations is the potential to perform "what if" studies to test hypotheses, predict functional outcomes, and identify emergent behaviors. This paper highlights applications using OpenSim, including projects which: minimize measures of an unreasonable simulation; identify new movements as an athletic training tool to reduce injury risk, and establish relationships among posture, muscle forces, and ground reaction forces. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to investigate the biomechanics and motor co-ordination in humans during stair climbing at different inclinations. Ten normal subjects ascended and descended a five-step staircase at three different inclinations (24??, 30??, 42??). Three steps were instrumented with force sensors and provided 6 dof ground reactions. Kinematics was analysed by a camera-based optoelectronic system. An inverse dynamics approach was applied to compute joint moments and powers. The different kinematic and kinetic patterns of stair ascent and descent were analysed and compared to level walking patterns. Temporal gait cycle parameters and ground reactions were not significantly affected by staircase inclination. Joint angles and moments showed a relatively low but significant dependency on the inclination. A large influence was observed in joint powers. This can be related to the varying amount of potential energy that has to be produced (during ascent) or absorbed (during descent) by the muscles. The kinematics and kinetics of staircase walking differ considerably from level walking. Interestingly, no definite signs could be found indicating that there is an adaptation or shift in the motor patterns when moving from level to stair walking. This can be clearly seen in the foot placement: compared to level walking, the forefoot strikes the ground first-independent from climbing direction and inclination. This and further findings suggest that there is a certain inclination angle or angular range where subjects do switch between a level walking and a stair walking gait pattern.

  Abstract                 = {The ankle contributes the majority of mechanical power during walking and is a frequently studied joint in biomechanics. Specifically, researchers have extensively investigated the torque-angle relationship for the ankle during dynamic tasks, such as walking and running. The slope of this relationship has been termed the "quasi-stiffness." However, over time, researchers have begun to interchange the concepts of quasi-stiffness and stiffness. This is an especially important distinction as researchers currently begin to investigate the appropriate control systems for recently developed powered prosthetic legs. The quasi-stiffness and stiffness are distinct concepts in the context of powered joints, and are equivalent in the context of passive joints. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the difference between the stiffness and quasi-stiffness using a simple impedance-controlled inverted pendulum model and a more sophisticated biped walking model, each with the ability to modify the trajectory of an impedance controller's equilibrium angle position. In both cases, stiffness values are specified by the controller and the quasi-stiffness are shown during a single step. Both models have widely varying quasi-stiffness but each have a single stiffness value. Therefore, from this simple modeling approach, the differences and similarities between these two concepts are elucidated.},

  Abstract                 = {The cyclic and often linear torque-angle relationship of locomotion presents the opportunity to innovate on the design of traditional series-elastic actuators (SEAs). In this paper, a novel modification to the SEA architecture was proposed by adding a clutch in parallel with the motor within the SEA--denoted as a CSEA. This addition permits bimodal dynamics where the system is characterized by an SEA when the clutch is disengaged and a passive spring when the clutch is engaged. The purpose of the parallel clutch was to provide the ability to store energy in a tuned series spring, while requiring only reactionary torque from the clutch. Thus, when the clutch is engaged, a tuned elastic relationship can be achieved with minimal electrical energy consumption. The state-based model of the CSEA is introduced and the implementation of the CSEA mechanism in a powered knee prosthesis is detailed. The series elasticity was optimized to fit the spring-like torque-angle relationship of early stance phase knee flexion and extension during level ground walking. In simulation, the CSEA knee required 70\% less electrical energy than a traditional SEA. Future work will focus on the mechanical implementation of the CSEA knee and an empirical demonstration of reduced electrical energy consumption during walking.},

METHODS: We performed an electronic search via the PubMed, EMBASE and ISI Web of Knowledge databases from 1979 to May 2009. Two independent reviewers assessed the title and abstract of each identified study. The quality assessment of the full text was undertaken using a 13-item checklist divided into three levels: A, B, and C. RESULTS: The literature search identified 584 abstracts to be considered. After applying the inclusion criteria, we reviewed the full text of a total of 89 articles. The mean article quality was 8??2. No A-level article was found; the primary reason was a negative score in blinded outcome assessment. Sixty-six articles (74\%) corresponded to a B-level, and two articles (2\%) corresponded to a C-level. Twenty-one articles (24\%) did not acquire enough points to be assigned to any level. In this study, we present and discuss the most commonly used and most relevant 32 parameters. Many of the parameters found were not reported in enough studies or in enough detail to allow a useful evaluation. CONCLUSION: This systematic review can help researchers compare, choose and develop the most appropriate gait evaluation protocol for their field of study, based on the articles with best scores on the criteria list and the relevance of specific biomechanical and physiological parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this project was to explore the nature of gait accommodations by unilateral below-knee amputees during walking. Lower extremity kinematic and kinetic data for two groups of subjects, 6 below-knee amputees (both prosthetic and intact limbs) and 6 able-bodied individuals (a single limb), were computed as subjects walked at 1.2 and 1.6 m/s. Kinematic profiles were similar for all three limb conditions. The largest difference between limbs occurred late in stance at the ankle joint when the prosthetic limb displayed substantially less planter flexion because of its passive response to unloading. Joint kinetic differences between limbs were most apparent at the knee. Whereas the net ankle and hip moments were similar for all three limb conditions, the net knee moment for the prosthetic leg deviated from the amputee intact and non-amputee limbs by remaining flexor throughout the stance phase. This response was attributed to an effort to reduce loading on and about the knee joint and stump of the prosthetic limb. Despite the absence of an extensor contribution from the prosthetic knee, the overall support moment on the prosthetic side was sufficient to provide a normal support function.},

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to examine outcomes associated with the use of these interventions among individuals with transfemoral limb loss. A search of biomedical databases identified 241 publications, of which 27 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed for methodological quality and content. We developed 28 empirical evidence statements (EESs) in 9 outcome categories (metabolic energy expenditure, activity, cognitive demand, gait mechanics, environmental obstacle negotiation, safety, preference and satisfaction, economics, and health and quality of life) based on findings in the literature. The level of evidence supporting these EESs varied due to quantity, quality, and consistency of the results. EESs supported by a moderate level of evidence that noted significant differences between MPKs and NMPKs were derived in five of the nine outcome categories. The results from this review suggest that evidence exists to inform clinical practice and that additional research is needed to confirm existing evidence and better understand outcomes associated with the use of NMPKs and MPKs.},

The amputation of all patients was caused by trauma. Variations of the prosthetic alignment affect the energy consumption of transfemoral amputees more significantly than that of transtibial amputees. Comparison of different prosthetic feet worn by transtibial amputees did not show significant differences regarding metabolic parameters. Compared with conventional hydraulic knee controls, the oxygen consumption of transfemoral amputees provided with an electronically controlled hydraulic knee joint is reduced.

  Abstract                 = {Movement science is driven by observation, but observation alone cannot elucidate principles of human and animal movement. Biomechanical modeling and computer simulation complement observations and inform experimental design. Biological models are complex and specialized software is required for building, validating, and studying them. Furthermore, common access is needed so that investigators can contribute models to a broader community and leverage past work. We are developing OpenSim, a freely available musculoskeletal modeling and simulation application and libraries specialized for these purposes, by providing: musculoskeletal modeling elements, such as biomechanical joints, muscle actuators, ligament forces, compliant contact, and controllers; and tools for fitting generic models to subject-specific data, performing inverse kinematics and forward dynamic simulations. OpenSim performs an array of physics-based analyses to delve into the behavior of musculoskeletal models by employing Simbody, an efficient and accurate multibody system dynamics code. Models are publicly available and are often reused for multiple investigations because they provide a rich set of behaviors that enables different lines of inquiry. This report will discuss one model developed to study walking and applied to gain deeper insights into muscle function in pathological gait and during running. We then illustrate how simulations can test fundamental hypotheses and focus the aims of in vivo experiments, with a postural stability platform and human model that provide a research environment for performing human posture experiments in silico. We encourage wide adoption of OpenSim for community exchange of biomechanical models and methods and welcome new contributors. ? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâˆ’protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â‰¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Characterizing the quasi-stiffness and work of lower extremity joints is critical for evaluating human locomotion and designing assistive devices such as prostheses and orthoses intended to emulate the biological behavior of human legs. This work aims to establish statistical models that allow us to predict the ankle quasi-stiffness and net mechanical work for adults walking on level ground. During the stance phase of walking, the ankle joint propels the body through three distinctive phases of nearly constant stiffness known as the quasi-stiffness of each phase. Using a generic equation for the ankle moment obtained through an inverse dynamics analysis, we identify key independent parameters needed to predict ankle quasi-stiffness and propulsive work and also the functional form of each correlation. These parameters include gait speed, ankle excursion, and subject height and weight. Based on the identified form of the correlation and key variables, we applied linear regression on experimental walking data for 216 gait trials across 26 subjects (speeds from 0.75-2.63 m/s) to obtain statistical models of varying complexity. The most general forms of the statistical models include all the key parameters and have an R(2) of 75{\%} to 81{\%} in the prediction of the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and propulsive work. The most specific models include only subject height and weight and could predict the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and work for optimal walking speed with average error of 13{\%} to 30{\%}. We discuss how these models provide a useful framework and foundation for designing subject- and gait-specific prosthetic and exoskeletal devices designed to emulate biological ankle function during level ground walking.},

  Abstract                 = {Multibody software designed for mechanical engineering has been successfully employed in biomedical research for many years. For real time operation some biomedical researchers have also adapted game physics engines. However, these tools were built for other purposes and do not fully address the needs of biomedical researchers using them to analyze the dynamics of biological structures and make clinically meaningful recommendations. We are addressing this problem through the development of an open source, extensible, high performance toolkit including a multibody mechanics library aimed at the needs of biomedical researchers. The resulting code, Simbody, supports research in a variety of fields including neuromuscular, prosthetic, and biomolecular simulation, and related research such as biologically-inspired design and control of humanoid robots and avatars. Simbody is the dynamics engine behind OpenSim, a widely used biomechanics simulation application. This article reviews issues that arise uniquely in biomedical research, and reports on the architecture, theory, and computational methods Simbody uses to address them. By addressing these needs explicitly Simbody provides a better match to the needs of researchers than can be obtained by adaptation of mechanical engineering or gaming codes. Simbody is a community resource, free for any purpose.

The purpose of this study was to compare knee joint contact forces and the muscles contributing to these forces between amputees and non-amputees during walking using forward dynamics simulations. We predicted that the intact knee contact forces would be higher than those of the residual leg and non-amputees. In the axial and mediolateral directions, the intact and non-amputee legs had greater peak tibio-femoral contact forces and impulses relative to the residual leg. The peak axial contact force was greater in the intact leg relative to the non-amputee leg, but the stance phase impulse was greater in the non-amputee leg. The vasti and hamstrings muscles in early stance and gastrocnemius in late stance were the largest contributors to the joint contact forces in the non-amputee and intact legs. Through dynamic coupling, the soleus and gluteus medius also had large contributions, even though they do not span the knee joint. In the residual leg, the prosthesis had large contributions to the joint forces, similar to the soleus in the intact and non-amputee legs. These results identify the muscles that contribute to knee joint contact forces during transtibial amputee walking and suggest that the peak knee contact forces may be more important than the knee contact impulses in explaining the high prevalence of intact leg osteoarthritis.},

  Abstract                 = {Proper selection of prosthetic foot-ankle components with appropriate design characteristics is critical for successful amputee rehabilitation. Elastic energy storage and return (ESAR) feet have been developed in an effort to improve amputee gait. However, the clinical efficacy of ESAR feet has been inconsistent, which could be due to inappropriate stiffness levels prescribed for a given amputee. Although a number of studies have analyzed the effect of ESAR feet on gait performance, the relationships between the stiffness characteristics and gait performance are not well understood. A challenge to understanding these relationships is the inability of current manufacturing techniques to easily generate feet with varying stiffness levels. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid prototyping framework using selective laser sintering (SLS) for the creation of prosthetic feet that can be used as a means to quantify the influence of varying foot stiffness on transtibial amputee walking. The framework successfully duplicated the stiffness characteristics of a commercial carbon fiber ESAR foot. The feet were mechanically tested and an experimental case study was performed to verify that the locomotor characteristics of the amputee's gait were the same when walking with the carbon fiber ESAR and SLS designs. Three-dimensional ground reaction force, kinematic, and kinetic quantities were measured while the subject walked at 1.2 m/s. The SLS foot was able to replicate the mechanical loading response and locomotor patterns of the ESAR foot within +/-2 standard deviations. This validated the current framework as a means to fabricate SLS-based ESAR prosthetic feet. Future work will be directed at creating feet with a range of stiffness levels to investigate appropriate prescription criteria.},

  Abstract                 = {Nematic liquid crystal elastomers are thermally actuated to produce macroscopic, anisotropic shape changes. Uniaxial contraction and extension of liquid crystal elastomers can be achieved by cycling the temperature of the material through the nematic to isotropic phase transition. In this report, a new approach is introduced by layering liquid crystal elastomer films to create thermally actuated stacks. A heating element and thermally conductive grease embedded between elastomer films provide a means for rapid internal heat application and distribution when a current is passed through the heating element, thus providing contractile force production in a minimal amount of time. Upon voltage application, stacks composed of two 100 ??m-thick films and a single heating element produce 18\% strain between contracted and relaxed states. In addition, the stacked elastomer films are capable of producing 10\% contraction within 1 s and the blocked stress of the thermally actuated stacked films is calculated to be 130 kPa. The stacking approach provides new opportunities to use liquid crystal elastomers in applications requiring forces greater than those capable of being produced by single elastomer films. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The device's sensor package includes a custom load cell to measure the sagittal socket interface moment above the knee joint, a custom sensorized foot to measure the ground reaction force at the heel and ball of the foot, and commercial potentiometers and load cells to measure joint positions and torques. A finite-state based impedance control approach, previously developed by the authors, is used and experimental results on level treadmill walking are presented that demonstrate the potential of the device to restore normal gait. The experimental power consumption of the device projects a walking distance of 5.0 km at a speed of 2.8 km/hr with a lithium polymer battery pack.},

Inspired by the above paper, we demonstrate here that, by exploiting the notion of topological-sensitivity (an alternate to SIMP), one can generate Pareto-optimal topologies in about twice the number of lines of Matlab code. In other words, optimal topologies for various volume fractions can be generated in a highly efficient manner, by directly tracing the Pareto-optimal curve.},

  Abstract                 = {Historically, clinical applications of measurements of force and energy followed electromyography and kinematics in temporal sequence. This sequence is mirrored by the order of topics included in this trilogy on the Evolution of Clinical Gait Analysis, with part I [Sutherland DH. The evolution of clinical gait analysis part I: kinesiological EMG. Gait Posture 2001;14:61-70.] devoted to Kinesiological EMG and part II [Sutherland DH. The evolution of clinical gait analysis part II - kinematics. Gait Posture 2002;16(2):159-179.] to Kinematics. This final review in the series will focus on kinetics as it relates to gait applications. Kinematic measurements give the movements of the body segments, which can be compared with normal controls to identify pathological gait patterns, but they do not deal with the forces controlling the movements. As a major goal of scientifically minded clinicians is to understand the biomechanical forces producing movements, the objective measurement of ground reaction forces is essential. The force plate (platform) is now an indispensable tool in a state-of-the-art motion analysis laboratory. Nonetheless, it is not a stand-alone instrument as both kinematic and EMG measurements are needed for maximum clinical implementation and interpretation of force plate measurements. The subject of energy assessment is also given mention, as there is a compelling interest in whether walking has been made easier with intervention. The goals of this manuscript are to provide a historical background, recognize some of the important contributors, and describe the current multiple uses of the force plate in gait analysis. The widespread use of force plates for postural analyses is an important and more recent application of this technology, but this review will be restricted to measurements of gait rather than balance activities. Finally, this manuscript presents my personal perspective and discusses the developments and contributors that have shaped my thoughts and actions, and which I have found to be particularly noteworthy or intriguing. Just as in parts I and II, emphasis has been placed on the early development. All subtopics and important contributors, in this third and certainly most challenging of the review papers, have not been included. Some may find that my perceptions are incomplete. I accept responsibility for all deficiencies, as none were intended. Letters to selected contributors and their responses reveal how each contributor built on the work of others. The level of cooperation and sharing by these early investigators is extraordinary. Had they wished to withhold information about their own work, clinical gait analysis would have been severely delayed.},

  Abstract                 = {Kinematics is treated as a single topic in this manuscript and the emphasis is on early history, just as it was in Part I, Electromyography. Needless to say, neither kinematics nor electromyography, nor kinetics and energy (the latter to be included in Part III) are stand-alone components of clinical gait analysis. The only reason for this selective format is that it lessens my task to be able to write about one subject at a time. One of the consequences of this arbitrary separation is that some contributors, who have enriched more than one portion of clinical gait analysis, are highlighted only in the area in which they have contributed the most. I began with Kinesiological Electromyography in Part I because the earliest stirrings of the dream of clinical gait analysis were expressed in the development of KEMG (kinesiological electromyography). The early investigators realized that very little could be said about the dynamic action of muscles without KEMG. Next, in chronological order, came kinematics. I have been an active participant and eyewitness, and take full responsibility for attempting to write an early history at a time when most of the contributors are still alive. Ordinarily, history is written much later, in order to fully grasp the significance of individual contributions in the tapestry of the whole. As stated in Part I, Electromyography, the emphasis has been placed on the early history. The application of motion analysis to sports medicine, and sports medicine functional analysis, is covered only lightly here, and this should not be interpreted as minimizing its importance. The literature on this subject is now quite voluminous and it would not be possible to cover it adequately in this manuscript. Later historical writings may differ significantly and will hopefully give more recognition to pioneers in later generations: those physicians, engineers, physical therapists and kinesiologists who are lifting the level of clinical gait analysis and directing their energies in expanding clinical directions. It is hoped that this manuscript will prompt additional manuscripts, as well as letters to the editor of Gait and Posture on the content of this review paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last half-century, the field of prosthetic engineering has continuously evolved with much attention being dedicated to restoring the mechanical energy properties of ankle joint musculatures during gait. However, the contributions of 'distal foot structures' (e.g., foot muscles, plantar soft tissue) have been overlooked. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the total mechanical energy profiles (e.g., power, work, and work-ratio) of the natural ankle-foot system (NAFS) by combining the contributions of the ankle joint and all distal foot structures during stance in level-ground steady state walking across various speeds (0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 statures/s). The results from eleven healthy subjects walking barefoot indicated ankle joint and distal foot structures generally performed opposing roles: the ankle joint performed net positive work that systematically increased its energy generation with faster walking speeds, while the distal foot performed net negative work that systematically increased its energy absorption with faster walking speeds. Accounting for these simultaneous effects, the combined ankle-foot system exhibited increased work-ratios with faster walking. Most notably, the work-ratio was not significantly greater than 1.0 during the normal walking speed of 0.8 statures/s. Therefore, a prosthetic design that strategically exploits passive-dynamic properties (e.g., elastic energy storage and return) has the potential to replicate the mechanical energy profiles of the NAFS during level-ground steady-state walking.},

  Abstract                 = {Performing simulated experiments on a virtual human or computer model is one of the most powerful methods to elucidate relationships between physiological structure and biomechanical performance. Surgical outcomes prediction, response to mechanical or therapy interventions, factors producing injury, theories of motor control and improved design of equipment are some areas that have been studied through simulation. Questions can be studied that may be difficult or even impossible, costly, and/or unethical to answer through human subject testing. The simulation framework lends itself to predicting the effect of neural, muscular, or skeletal alterations on performance. Biology, physics, and engineering relations are used to create the model or mathematical representation of the body. Because a variety of strategies can produce a single movement, similarity of model performance to reality does not ensure consistency between mathematical and natural control schemes. Assessing this consistency is a major obstacle to obtaining maximum benefit from simulation. Biomechanical simulation is a developing field; much effort goes into developing, controlling, and validating models. However, inroads to using models to answer questions relevant to rehabilitation are being made. An overview of the role of simulation, description of model development, and examples of some modeling and simulation applications in gait analysis are provided in this chapter. As the field matures, efficient control techniques, supercomputing resources, and accurate subject specific data from advanced imaging techniques are a few areas that can significantly enhance the practical utility of simulation as a clinical tool.},

However, the complex nonlinear dynamics of the PAM manipulator makes it a challenging and appealing system for modeling and control design. The problems with the time variance, compliance, high hysteresis and nonlinearity of pneumatic systems have made it difficult to realize precise position control with high speed. In order to realize satisfactory control performance, the effect of nonlinear factors contained in thePAM manipulator must be considered. The purpose of this study is to improve the control performance of thePAM manipulator using a nonlinearPID controller. Superb mixture of conventionalPID controller and the neural network, which has powerful capability of learning, adaptation and tackling nonlinearity, brings us a novel nonlinearPID controller using neural network. This proposed controller is appropriate for a kind of plants with nonlinearity uncertainties and disturbances. The experiments were carried out in practicalPAM manipulator and the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm was demonstrated through the experiments, which suggests its superior performance and disturbance rejection.},

However, restraining biomechanical issues such as considerable bone loss around the stem and peri-prosthetic bone fractures are present. To overcome these limiting issues a new concept of the direct intramedullary fixation was developed. We hypothesize that the new design will reduce the peri-prosthetic bone failure risk and adverse bone remodeling by restoring the natural load transfer in the femur. Generic CT-based finite element models of an intact femur and amputated bones implanted with 3 analyzed implants were created and loaded with a normal walking and a forward fall load. The strain adaptive bone remodeling theory was used to predict long-term bone changes around the implants and the periprosthetic bone failure risk was evaluated by the von Mises stress criterion. The results show that the new design provides close to physiological distribution of stresses in the bone and lower bone failure risk for the normal walking as compared to the OPRA and the ISP implants. The bone remodeling simulations did not reveal any overall bone loss around the new design, as opposed to the OPRA and the ISP implants, which induce considerable bone loss in the distal end of the femur. This positive outcome shows that the presented concept has a potential to considerably improve safety of the rehabilitation with the direct fixation implants.},

  Abstract                 = {An alternative to prosthetic socket rehabilitation of patients with transfemoral amputation is realized by means of direct skeletal fixation devices. offering significant improvements in mobility and comfort. However, strain shielding due to high stiffness of these metal-based implants causes considerable and progressive bone loss. To overcome this phenomenon a new concept of a direct fixation implant, in form of a collared metallic pin articulating inside a polymer intramedullary part, was developed. In this study we used experimental and finite element techniques to assess whether the novel concept produced a more physiological strain distribution in the bone as compared to a standard titanium implant. Cortical strains were measured experimentally on seven human cadaver femora, both intact and implanted with a generic standard implant and the new implant. Three load configurations were considered, simulating: heel strike, toe off and one leg stance. A finite element model derived from computed tomography data was used to calculate strains in intact bone and bone with generic models of the two implant types. Significant strain shielding occurred around both implant types, albeit that for the novel design strain shielding was generally less (p<0.04). Significant differences in strain shielding between both implant types were obtained for heel strike at the distal (p<0.04) and the middle level (p<0.03), as well as for the one leg stance at the middle level (p<0.03) showing 21-29\% less strain shielding for the new implant in these cases. Finite element results were in agreement with the experimental findings: more strain shielding for the standard implant as compared to the novel design. In fact, the benefit of the new design was bigger in the simulations as compared to the experimental measurements, which was attributed to the idealized collar-cortex fit in the FE model of the new design which was not obtained in the experiments. In conclusion, the study showed that the new implant has a potential to increase distal load transfer to the femur and reduce strain shielding as compared with the standard implant. Collar-cortex contact is an important aspect and requires further attention when developing the surgical technique. The encouraging results obtained in this study justify further development of this concept in order to improve the quality and applicability of direct skeletal fixation devices for patients requiring a transfemoral amputation.},

  Abstract                 = {Direct attachment of an upper leg prosthesis to the skeletal system by a percutaneous implant is an alternative solution to the traditional socket fixation. In this study, we investigated long-term periprosthetic bone changes around two types of fixation implants using two different initial conditions, namely immediate post-amputation implantation and the conventional implantation after considerable time of socket prosthesis use. We questioned the difference in bone modeling response the implants provoked and if it could lead to premature bone fracture. Generic CT-based finite element models of an intact femoral bone and amputated bone implanted with models of two existing direct-fixation implants, the OPRA system (Integrum AB) and the ISP Endo/Exo prosthesis (ESKA Implants AG) were created for this study. Adaptive bone-remodeling simulations used the heel-strike and toe-off loads from a normal walking cycle. The bone loss caused by prolonged use of socket prosthesis had more severe effects on the ultimate bone quality than adaptation induced by the direct-fixation implants. Both implants showed considerable bone remodeling; the titanium screw implant (OPRA system) provoked more bone loss than the porous coated CoCrMo stem (ISP implant). The chance of the peri-prosthetic bone fracture remained higher for the post-socket case as compared to the direct amputation cases. In conclusion, both direct-fixation implants lead to considerable bone loss and bone loss is more severe after a prolonged period of post-socket use. Hence, from a biomechanical perspective it is better to limit the post-socket time and to re-design direct fixation devices to reduce bone loss and the probability of peri-prosthetic bone fractures.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To compare energy cost of walking (ECW) and prosthesis-related perceived mobility with the Marlo Anatomical Socket (MAS(??)) and the Ischial Containment (IC) Socket. METHOD: Transfemoral (TF) amputees were enrolled in the study. ECW tests were conducted inside, in a hallway with a regular floor surface. Subjects had to walk back and forth on a 61m linear course at their own self-selected speed. Metabolic and heart rate data were collected during the walking test using a portable gas analyzer. All measurements were made at steady state (SS). The tests were performed first using the IC socket and then after 30 days of MAS(??) use; the last test was carried out after 60 days of MAS(??) use. The amputees were also administered the Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire Mobility Section (PEQ MS) at the first and the last test to assess perceived potential for mobility using the prosthesis. RESULTS: Seven long-term prosthesis users were analyzed. Their mean age was 33.9??9.3 years; all were employed, active, and used IC sockets. At the third walking test, the ECW with the MAS(??) was significantly lower than that with the IC socket (p=.016). PEQ MS data also improved significantly at the last evaluation (p<.018). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that using the MAS(??), lowering the ECW and improving PEQ MS, could be a valid prosthesis design for active TF amputees compared to their usual IC socket.},

  Abstract                 = {This study describes the changes in hip and pelvic kinematics in 19 trans-femoral amputees, who were treated with an osseointegrated trans-femoral prosthesis. Patients were studied with 3-dimensional gait analysis, walking with socket prosthesis within two days before the osseointergration procedure. The post-operative gait analysis was carried out at the 2 year follow-up visit. Fifty-seven; age-, side- and gender-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Post-operative data showed that patients who had an osseointegrated transfemoral prosthesis increased their hip extension by 7.3?? (p=0.007), changing from -2.6?? (range -13.4?? to 10.7??) to -9.9?? (range -29.4?? to 5??). Moreover, the pre-operative anterior pelvic tilt was reduced by 4.0?? (p=0.016), changing from 21.7?? (range 11.9-34.8??) to 17.7?? (range 5.5-25.7??). Values for hip extension and pelvic tilt changed toward those of controls. These results confirm that patients treated with osseointegrated trans-femoral prosthesis encounter significant changes of their kinematic pattern in terms of hip extension and anterior pelvic tilt. Even though the changes were moderate they may, in the long-term have a positive influence on low-back biomechanics and could contribute to reducing the risk of further problems with low back pain.},

This paper presents an overview of the different VIAs developed and proposes a classification based on the principles through which the variable stiffness and damping are achieved. The main classes are active impedance by control, inherent compliance and damping actuators, inertial actuators, and combinations of them, which are then further divided into subclasses. This classification allows for designers of new devices to orientate and take inspiration and users of VIA???s to be guided in the design and implementation process for their targeted application.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a control architecture and intent recognition approach for the real-time supervisory control of a powered lower limb prosthesis. The approach infers user intent to stand, sit, or walk, by recognizing patterns in prosthesis sensor data in real time, without the need for instrumentation of the sound-side leg. Specifically, the intent recognizer utilizes time-based features extracted from frames of prosthesis signals, which are subsequently reduced to a lower dimensionality (for computational efficiency). These data are initially used to train intent models, which classify the patterns as standing, sitting, or walking. The trained models are subsequently used to infer the user's intent in real time. In addition to describing the generalized control approach, this paper describes the implementation of this approach on a single unilateral transfemoral amputee subject and demonstrates via experiments the effectiveness of the approach. In the real-time supervisory control experiments, the intent recognizer identified all 90 activity-mode transitions, switching the underlying middle-level controllers without any perceivable delay by the user. The intent recognizer also identified six activity-mode transitions, which were not intended by the user. Due to the intentional overlapping functionality of the middle-level controllers, the incorrect classifications neither caused problems in functionality, nor were perceived by the user.},

  Abstract                 = {In an effort to improve amputee gait, energy storage and return (ESAR) prosthetic feet have been developed to provide enhanced function by storing and returning mechanical energy through elastic structures. However, the effect of ESAR feet on muscle activity in amputee walking is not well understood. Previous studies have analyzed commercial prosthetic feet with a wide range of material properties and geometries, making it difficult to associate specific ESAR properties with changes in muscle activity. In contrast, prosthetic ankles offer a systematic way to manipulate ESAR properties while keeping the prosthetic heel and keel geometry intact. In the present study, ESAR ankles were added to a Seattle Lightfoot2 to carefully control the energy storage and return by altering the ankle stiffness and orientation in order to identify its effect on lower extremity muscle activity during below-knee amputee walking. A total of five foot conditions were analyzed: solid ankle (SA), stiff forward-facing ankle (FA), compliant FA, stiff reverse-facing ankle (RA) and compliant RA. The ESAR ankles decreased the activity of muscles that contribute to body forward propulsion and increased the activity of muscles that provide body support. The compliant ankles generally caused a greater change in muscle activity than the stiff ankles, but without a corresponding increase in energy return. Ankle orientation also had an effect, with RA generally causing a lower change in muscle activity than FA. These results highlight the influence of ESAR stiffness on muscle activity and the importance of prescribing appropriate prosthetic foot stiffness to improve rehabilitation outcomes.},

Firstly, we investigate whether contact times, as recorded by pedobarographic systems during quadrupedal and bipedal walking of bonobos, can be used to reliably calculate actual velocities, by applying formulae based on lateral-view video recordings. Secondly, we investigate the effect of speed on peak plantar pressures during bipedal and quadrupedal walking of the bonobo. Data were obtained from 4 individuals from a group of bonobos at the Animal Park Planckendael. From our study, we can conclude that both walking speeds calculated from contact times and lower leg length or simply from recorded contact times are good estimators for walking speed, when direct observation of the latter is impossible. Further, it was found that effects of speed on peak plantar pressures and vertical forces are absent or at least subtle in comparison to a large variation in pressure patterns. In bonobos, the same pressure patterns are used at all walking speeds, and, in consequence, we do not expect major changes in foot function.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous prosthetic feet are currently on the market for individuals with a transtibial amputation, each device aimed at raising the 3C-level (control, comfort and cosmetics) with slightly different characteristics. In general, prosthetic feet can be classified into three categories. These are, following the time line: conventional feet (CF), energy-storing-and-returning (ESR) feet and the recent so-called 'bionic' feet. Researchers have shown enhanced performance properties of ESR feet compared with early CF. However, even with the advanced technology, none of the ESR feet is capable of significantly reducing energy cost of walking or enhancing prosthetic gait (Nielsen et al. J Prosthet Orthotics 1989;1:24-31; Waters et al. J Bone Joint Surg Am 1976;58:42-46; Torburn et al. J Rehabil Res Dev 1990;27:369-384). From the 1990s, gradually more attention has been paid to the incorporation of active elements in prosthetic feet as the passive devices are not capable of providing the individual with sufficient ankle power during gait. Most part of the 'bionic' devices are still on the research level nowadays but one can expect that they will become available on the market soon. In this article, the evolution of prosthetic feet over the last two decades is reflected. The importance of mimicking human ankle-foot biomechanics with prosthetic feet is briefly discussed. Prior work in both objective and subjective evaluation of prosthetic gait is reported.},

  Abstract                 = {3D printing hardware is rapidly scaling up to output continuous mixtures of multiple materials at increasing resolution over ever larger print volumes. This poses an enormous computational chal- lenge: large high-resolution prints comprise trillions of voxels and petabytes of data and simply modeling and describing the input with spatially varying material mixtures at this scale is challeng- ing. Existing 3D printing software is insufficient; in particular, most software is designed to support only a few million primitives, with discrete material choices per object. We present OpenFab, a programmable pipeline for synthesis of multi-material 3D printed objects that is inspired by RenderMan and modern GPU pipelines. The pipeline supports procedural evaluation of geometric detail and material composition, using shader-like fablets, allowing models to be specified easily and efficiently. We describe a streaming archi- tecture for OpenFab; only a small fraction of the final volume is stored in memory and output is fed to the printer with little startup delay. We demonstrate it on a variety of multi-material objects. CR},

  Abstract                 = {Patient-specific tissue-mimicking phantoms are becoming available with the advent of additive manufacturing. Phantoms currently in use are focused on the geometrical accuracy and mechanical properties under small deformation. Mimicking the mechanical properties at large deformation is challenging because of the inherent difference between the mechanical behaviors of polymeric materials and that of human tissues. In this study, the mechanical behavior of soft tissues under a uniaxial tension is mimicked by dual-material 3D printed meta-materials with stiff micro-structured fibers embedded in a soft polymeric matrix. Although the two base materials are strain-softening polymers, some of the designed meta-materials demonstrate certain degree of strain-stiffening behavior. Further investigation shows how the stress-strain curve of the meta-materials can be controlled by the design parameters. Sensitivity analysis is used to study the effects of each parameter. General design guidelines are proposed based on the results of the experiments. Dual-material 3D printed meta-materials have great potential in fabricating patient-specific phantoms with accurate mechanical properties that are associated with the gender, age, ethnicity, and other physiological/pathological characteristics. Mechanically accurate phantoms can play an important role in a variety of biomedical applications, including validation of computational models, testing of medical devices, surgery planning, medical education and training, and doctor-patient interaction.},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

  Abstract                 = {Additive manufacturing (AM), colloquially known as 3D printing, is currently being promoted as the spark of a new industrial revolution. The technology allows one to make customized products without incurring any cost penalties in manufacturing as neither tools nor molds are required. Moreover, AM enables the production of complex and integrated functional designs in a one-step process, thereby also potentially reducing the need for assembly work. In this article, we discuss the impact of AM technology at both firm and industry level. Our intention is to discern how market structures will be affected from an operations management perspective. Based on an analysis of established economic models, we first identify the economic and technological characteristics of AM and distill four key principles relevant to manufacturers at firm level. We then critically assess the effects of AM at industry level by analyzing the validity of earlier assumptions in the models when these four principles apply. In so doing, we derive a set of seven propositions which provide impetus for future research. In particular, we propose that in a monopoly, the adoption of AM allows a firm to increase profits by capturing consumer surplus when flexibly producing customized products. Meanwhile in competitive markets, competition is spurred as AM may lower barriers to market entry and offers the ability to serve multiple markets at once. This should ultimately result in lower prices for consumers.},

  Abstract                 = {Gait analysis is the systematic study of human walking, using the eye and brain of experienced observers, augmented by instrumentation for measuring body movements, body mechanics and the activity of the muscles. In individuals with conditions affecting their ability to walk, gait analysis may be used to make detailed diagnoses and to plan optimal treatment. Over the past few years, gait analysis has ???come of age??? and in a number of centers it is now used routinely to provide the best possible care for certain groups of patients, most notably those with cerebral palsy. Since the benefits of this approach have been well established, it is to be hoped that its usage will continue to spread, so that many more will benefit from the better treatment decisions which can be made when gait analysis is used. I am happy to believe that the first three editions of this book have contributed to this process, by providing a text which does not require a high level of academic learning to be understood. I have heard from people all over the world that they have found the book useful and this I find very gratifying. The next stage in the evolution of gait analysis will hopefully involve improvements in the ease and speed with which gait data can be collected and interpreted, and decreases in the cost of the equipment and the skill level needed to use it. Significant strides have been made in all these aspects since the third edition of the book was published},

Therefore, this study monitored the socket pressure at specific locations of the stump when using a microprocessor-controlled adaptive prosthetic ankle under different walking conditions. METHODS: Twelve unilateral transtibial amputees between 43 and 59 years of age were provided with the Proprio-Foot (Ossur) and underwent an instrumented 3D gait analysis in level, stair, and incline walking, including synchronous data capturing of socket pressure. Peak pressures and pressure time integrals (PTI) at three different locations were compared for five walking conditions with and without using the device's ankle adaptation mode. FINDINGS: Highest peak pressures of 2.4 k Pa/kg were found for incline ascent at the calf muscle as compared to 2.1 k Pa/kg in level walking with large inter-individual variance. In stair ascent a strong correlation was found between maximum knee moment and socket pressure. The most significant pressure changes relative to level walking were seen in ramp descent anteriorly towards the stump end, with PTI values being almost twice as high as those in level walking. Adapting the angle of the prosthesis on stairs and ramps modified the pressure data such that they were closer to those in level walking. INTERPRETATION: Pressure at the stump depends on the knee moments involved in each walking condition. Adapting the prosthetic ankle angle is a valuable means of modifying joint kinetics and thereby the pressure distribution at the stump. However, large inter-individual differences in local pressures underline the importance of individual socket fitting.},

  Abstract                 = {An optimization-based formulation and solution method are presented to predict asymmetric human gait for a large-scale skeletal model. Predictive dynamics approach is used in which both the joint angles and joint torques are treated as unknowns in the equations of motion. For the optimization formulation, the joint angle profiles are treated as the primary unknowns, and velocities and accelerations are calculated using them. In numerical implementation, the joint angle profiles are discretized using the B-spline interpolation. An algorithm is presented to inversely calculate the joint torques and the ground reaction forces. The sum of the joint-torques squared, called the dynamic effort, is minimized as the human performance measure. Constraints are imposed on the joint strengths (torques) and joint ranges of motion along with other physical constraints. The formulation is validated by simulating a symmetric gait and comparing the results with the experimental data. Then asymmetric gait motion is simulated, where the left and right step lengths are different. The kinematics and kinetics results from the simulation are presented and discussed. Predicted ground reaction forces are explained by using the inverted pendulum model. Predicted kinematics and kinetics have trends that are similar to those reported in the literature. Potential practical applications of the formulation and the solution approach are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

An exploration of the design process undertaken in an industrial design honours year demonstrates how a low-cost (approx.

Prototyping was undertaken using a hobby-level printer (the Makerbot Replicator 2) and Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament. This method of prototyping allowed the designer to undertake rapid iterations of the prototype to undergo basic testing using autoethnographic methods. The prosthesis? ability to be modified and produced on-site, on- demand could potentially redefine the opportunities available to prosthetists for accommodating varying gait patterns when providing low-cost aid to developing countries.},

  Abstract                 = {People with unilateral, transtibial amputation (TTA) have an increased prevalence of chronic low back pain (LBP) relative to able-bodied people. However, a definitive cause of increased LBP susceptibility has not been determined. The purpose of this work was to compare dynamic trunk???pelvis biomechanics between people with (n=6) and without (n=6) unilateral TTA during walking using a computational modeling approach. A generic, muscle-actuated whole body model was scaled to each participant, and experimental walking data were used in a static optimization framework to calculate trunk???pelvis motion, L4L5 joint contact forces, and muscle forces within the trunk???pelvis region. Results included several significant between-group differences in trunk???pelvis biomechanics during different phases of the gait cycle. Most significant was greater lateral bending toward the residual side during residual single-limb stance (p<0.01), concurrent with an elevated L4L5 joint contact force (p=0.02) and greater muscle force from the intact-side obliques (p<0.01) in people with TTA relative to able-bodied people. During both double-limb support phases, people with TTA also had a greater range of axial trunk rotation away from the leading limb, concurrent with greater ranges of muscle forces in the erector spinae and obliques. In addition, a greater range of force (p=0.03) in residual-side psoas was found during early residual limb swing in people with TTA. Repeated exposure to atypical motion and joint/muscle loading in people with TTA may contribute to the development of secondary musculoskeletal disorders, including chronic, mechanical LBP.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the impact force during foot-ground impact activities such as the running. A previously developed model is used for this study. The model is a lumped-parameter one consisting of four masses connected to each other via linear springs and viscous dampers. A shoe-specific nonlinear function is used for representation of the ground reaction force. The authors have previously showed that the previous version of the model as well as its simulation is incorrect. This paper slightly modifies the previous model so as it is able to produce results in agreement with the experiments. Then, the modified model is simulated for two typical shoe types. A parametric study is also conducted. The parametric study concerns with the effects of masses, mass ratios, stiffness constants, and damping coefficients on the dynamics of the impact. It is shown that the impact forces increase as the rigid and wobbling masses increase. However, the increase in the impact forces is not the same for all the masses. It is found that the impact force increases as the touchdown velocities increase. Simulations imply that the variations of the damping coefficients result in larger variations of the impact force compared to the stiffness. The effect of the variation of gravity on the simulated impact force is also explored. It is concluded that both the first and the second peaks of the impact force are increased with gravity. An in-depth discussion is included to compare results of the current paper with results of other investigators.},

  Abstract                 = {Lower-limb amputees expend more energy to walk than non-amputees and have an elevated risk of secondary disabilities. Insufficient push-off by the prosthetic foot may be a contributing factor. We aimed to systematically study the effect of prosthetic foot mechanics on gait, to gain insight into fundamental prosthetic design principles. We varied a single parameter in isolation, the energy-storing spring in a prototype prosthetic foot, the controlled energy storage and return (CESR) foot, and observed the effect on gait. Subjects walked on the CESR foot with three different springs. We performed parallel studies on amputees and on non-amputees wearing prosthetic simulators. In both groups, spring characteristics similarly affected ankle and body center-of-mass (COM) mechanics and metabolic cost. Softer springs led to greater energy storage, energy return, and prosthetic limb COM push-off work. But metabolic energy expenditure was lowest with a spring of intermediate stiffness, suggesting biomechanical disadvantages to the softest spring despite its greater push-off. Disadvantages of the softest spring may include excessive heel displacements and COM collision losses. We also observed some differences in joint kinetics between amputees and non-amputees walking on the prototype foot. During prosthetic push-off, amputees exhibited reduced energy transfer from the prosthesis to the COM along with increased hip work, perhaps due to greater energy dissipation at the knee. Nevertheless, the results indicate that spring compliance can contribute to push-off, but with biomechanical trade-offs that limit the degree to which greater push-off might improve walking economy.},

  Abstract                 = {The elastic stretch-shortening cycle of the Achilles tendon during walking can reduce the active work demands on the plantarflexor muscles in series. However, this does not explain why or when this ankle work, whether by muscle or tendon, needs to be performed during gait. We therefore employ a simple bipedal walking model to investigate how ankle work and series elasticity impact economical locomotion. Our model shows that ankle elasticity can use passive dynamics to aid push-off late in single support, redirecting the body's center-of-mass (COM) motion upward. An appropriately timed, elastic push-off helps to reduce dissipative collision losses at contralateral heelstrike, and therefore the positive work needed to offset those losses and power steady walking. Thus, the model demonstrates how elastic ankle work can reduce the total energetic demands of walking, including work required from more proximal knee and hip muscles. We found that the key requirement for using ankle elasticity to achieve economical gait is the proper ratio of ankle stiffness to foot length. Optimal combination of these parameters ensures proper timing of elastic energy release prior to contralateral heelstrike, and sufficient energy storage to redirect the COM velocity. In fact, there exist parameter combinations that theoretically yield collision-free walking, thus requiring zero active work, albeit with relatively high ankle torques. Ankle elasticity also allows the hip to power economical walking by contributing indirectly to push-off. Whether walking is powered by the ankle or hip, ankle elasticity may aid walking economy by reducing collision losses.},

  Abstract                 = {Previously developed user-intent-recognition (UIR) systems have demonstrated promising accuracy for identifying the user's locomotion mode, which is potentially useful for volitional control of powered artificial legs in ambulation. The fundamental question facing us now is whether or not the prosthesis users are safe when the UIR system is directly integrated with the intrinsic controller to operate powered artificial legs. In this preliminary study, we aimed to address this question by investigating the effect of UIR errors on the walking stability of users, wearing a UIR-controlled powered transfemoral (TF) prosthesis. First, a novel control of powered prosthesis was developed, which hierarchically connected our designed UIR system with an intrinsic controller. Three types of errors were purposely added into the UIR output at different gait phase while an able-bodied subject walked on a treadmill with the powered prosthesis. Subjective opinions were obtained to evaluate the effect of applied UIR errors on the user's walking balance. The kinematics and kinetics of the prosthetic knee were quantified while the errors occurred. The preliminary results showed that not all the UIR errors applied caused a subjective feeling of balance instability. The effects of UIR errors on the prosthesis control and user's balance depended on the gait phase when the errors happened and the amount of mechanical work applied to the knee joint caused by the errors. The results of this study could aid the future design of true bionic prostheses that enable lower limb amputees to perform various activities intuitively and safely.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: To estimate the current prevalence of limb loss in the United States and project the future prevalence to the year 2050. Design: Estimates were constructed using age-, sex-, and race-specific incidence rates for amputation combined with age-, sex-, and race-specific assumptions about mortality. In- cidence rates were derived from the 1988 to 1999 Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, corrected for the likelihood of reamputation among those undergoing amputation for vascular disease. Incidence rates were assumed to remain constant over time and applied to historic mortality and population data along with the best available estimates of relative risk, future mortality, and future population projections. To investigate the sensitivity of our projections to increasing or decreasing incidence, we devel- oped alternative sets of estimates of limb loss related to dys- vascular conditions based on assumptions of a 10\% or 25\% increase or decrease in incidence of amputations for these conditions.},
